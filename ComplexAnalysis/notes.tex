\heading{The Complex Analysis and Applications}

The content of this lecture note will be mostly based on the course MATH 305 (Applied Complex Analysis) at UBC during Winter2, 2023 term. However, I have expanded the content and examples using the following text books as well:



\begin{itemize}
\item Fundamentals of Complex Analysis for Mathematics, Science and Engineering,(Third Edition) by E. Saff, A. Snider.
\item Visual Complex Functions: An Introduction with Phase Portraits by Elias Wegert
\end{itemize}
