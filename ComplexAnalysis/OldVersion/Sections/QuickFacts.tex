\subsection{Analytic Functions}

\begin{fact}[Harmonic Function]
	Let $f: D \to \C$ be a holomorphic function in the connected open set $D \subseteq \C$, where $f(x,y) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)$ where $u,v: \R^2 \to \R$. Then the function $u,v$ are harmonic functions.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
	Since $f$ is holomorphic in the open connected subset $D \subseteq \C$, then it means that the function $u,v$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, the first derivatives exists, and are continuous. As we will show later, in fact $u,v$ are smooth function, so any higher derivative exists and is continuous.
	From Cauchy-Riemann we have
	\[ u_x = v_y, \quad u_y = - v_x. \]
	Calculating the second derivatives will yield
	\[ u_{xx} = v_{yx}, \quad u_{yy} = -v_{xy}. \]
	Note that since $u,v$ are smooth, then $v_{xy} = v_{yx}$. Then we can conclude that 
	\[ u_xx + u_yy = 0, \]
	which indicates that $u$ is a harmonic function (it satisfies the Laplace equation). The same reasoning works for $v$.
\end{proof}

\begin{fact}[Harmonic Conjugate Function]
	Let $u: \Omega \to R$ be a harmonic function define on the connected open set $\Omega \subseteq \R^2$. Then $v: \Omega \to \R$ is a \emph{harmonic conjugate} of $u$ if and only if the function $f$ of the complex variable $z := x+iy \in \Omega $ is holomorphic.
\end{fact}

\begin{exm}
	\label{exm:harmonicConjugateExample}
	Construct an analytic function whose real part is $u(x,y) = x^3 - 3xy^2 + y$.
\end{exm}


\begin{answer}
	Let $f(z) = u(x,y)+i v(x,y)$ holomorphic as required. Then it should satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
	\[ v_y = 3x^2 - 3y^2 , \quad v_x = 6xy -1. \]
	Integrating the first expression yields in  $v(x,y) = 3x^2y - y^3 + f(x)$ and differentiating it and comparing it with the second expression above yields $f(x) = -x + C$ for some $C \in \R$. Thus a complex conjugate of $u(x,y)$ will be
	\[ v(x,y) = 3x^2y + y^3 - x + C. \]
\end{answer}

\begin{fact}
	Let $f: \Omega \to \C$ where $\Omega \subseteq \C$ is an open connected set. Assume $f(x+iy) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)$. If $f$ is holomorphic at $\Omega$, then $v$ is a harmonic conjugate function of $u$. Further more, the level sets of these function are perpendicular to each other everywhere in the domain $\Omega$.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
	let $(x_0,y_0) \in \Omega$. The gradient of $u$ and $v$ are given as
	\[ \nabla u = (u_x, u_y), \quad \nabla v = (v_x, v_y). \]
	When evaluated at $(x_0, y_0)$, they will be the vectors perpendicular to the corresponding level curves. We calculate the inner product of these vectors.
	\[ \nabla u (x_0, y_0) \cdot \nabla v(x_0, v_0) = u_x(x_0,y_0) y_x(x_0, y_0) + u_y(x_0, y_0) v_y(x_0, y_0) \]
	Since $f$ is holomorphic at $\Omega$, then it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Thus we get 
	\[ \nabla u (x_0, y_0) \cdot \nabla v(x_0, v_0) = 0. \] 
	This implies that the level curves are perpendicular.
\end{proof}
The following figure shows this fact for the harmonic conjugate functions we calculated in Example \autoref{exm:harmonicConjugateExample}.

\begin{fact}[Harmonic Conjugacy is Not Symmetric]
	If $v$ is a harmonic conjugate of $u$, then it means that $f(x+iy)=u(x,y) + i v(x,y)$ is holomorphic at the open, connected disk of definition. Then this implies that $if(x+iy)=-v + iu$ is holomorphic as well. Thus we conclude that $u$ is a harmonic conjugate of $-v$.
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}[The parallel between Picard iteration and Newton's method]
	As we know from Galois theory, there are no closed form formula for the roots of polynomials of order 5 and higher. On the other hand, from the fundamental theorem of algebra we know that such roots exists and the number of roots is in fact the same as the degree of polynomials (multiplicity counted). However, in general, to find the roots of the degree 5 or higher polynomials we use the methods like the Newton's method. There is a beautiful parallel between this and the Picard iteration in finding the solution of an ODE. In both cases, we use an iterative approach to find the solution of a particular equation.

\subsection{Polynomials and Rational Functions}

\begin{fact}
	Every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one zero in $\C$. It immediately follows that every polynomial of degree $n$ denoted by $P_n(z)$ with complex coefficients has exactly $n$ zeros in $\C$ (counting multiplicities). Thus we can factor every polynomial as
	\[ P_n(z) = a_n (z-z_1)^{d_1}(z-z_2)^{d_2} \hdots (z-z_k)^{d_k}, \]
	where $d_1 + d_2 + \cdots + d_k = n$.
	
	Then when we say the polynomial $P_n(z)$ has zero of order $m$, it means that we can write it as
	\[ P_n(z) = (z-z_0)^m Q(z), \]
	where $Q(z)$ is a degree $n-m$ polynomial such that $Q(z_0) \neq 0$.
\end{fact}


\hrule


\begin{fact}
	We can use the following trick to expand any polynomial about any $z_0 \in \C$. For instance, we want to express the polynomial $P_3(z) = -2z^3 -4z^2 + 10z + 12$ in terms of powers of $(z-1)$. To do this we can write $P_3(z) = a_0 + a_1(z-1)+a_2(z-1)^2 + a_3(z-1)^3$, and it only remains to determine the coefficients. It immediately reveals that 
	\begin{align*}
		P_3(1) &= a_0, \\
		P_3'(1) &= a_1, \\
		P_3''(1) &= 2 a_2, \\
		P_3'''(1) &= 2\cdot 3 a_3.
	\end{align*}
	thus we can easily calculate the unknown coefficients. 
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}[Poles of a Function]
	A rational function is a function that the ratio of two polynomials. I.e.
	\[ R_{r,s}(z) = \frac{P_r(z)}{Q_s(z)}. \]
	The rational function is not defined at the zeros of the denominator. However, we can cancel out any common zeros in the denominator and numerator and then arrive at the following expression
	\[ F(z) = \frac{a_m(z-z_1)(z-z_2)\cdots(z-z_m)}{b_n(z-\xi_1)(z-\xi_2)\cdots(z-\xi_n)} \]
	Note that the common zeros of the numerator and the denominator are canceled. Then the set $\{ \xi_1, \xi_2, \cdots, \xi_n \}$ are the poles of the rational function $F$. However, if we want to also count the multiplicities, we can write
	\[ F(z) = \frac{a_m(z-z_1)^{d_1}(z-z_2)^{d_2}\cdots(z-z_k)^{d_k}}{b_n(z-\xi_1)^{t_1}(z-\xi_2)^{t_2}\cdots(z-\xi_l)^{t_l}}, \]
	from which we can infer that for example $\xi_1$ is a pole of degree $t_1$, etc.
	
	\textbf{In a nutshell,} the zero of order $m$ of denominator is the pole of degree $m$ of the rational function. Thus it immediately follows that if $\xi_1$ is the pole of order $t_1$ of  $F(z)$, then we can write
	\[ H(z) = (z-\xi_1)^{t_1} F(z), \] 
	in which we have
	\[ \lim_{z\to \xi_1} H(z) \neq 0 < \infty. \]
	
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}[Partial Fraction Decomposition]
	The rational functions $R_{m,n} = \frac{P_m(z)}{Q_n(z)}$ can be written as partial fractions. Note that when $m>n$, we first need to do the long division and then do the partial fraction. The following example makes this more clear.
\end{fact}

\begin{exm}
	Do partial fraction decomposition for the following rational function.
	\[ F(z) = \frac{2z^4+7z^3+10z^2+6z+1}{z^3+3z^2+3z+1}. \]
\end{exm}

\begin{answer}
	First we need to do the long division, since the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of denominator. After doing the long division we will have
	\[ F(z) = 2z + 1 + \frac{z^2 + 2z + 1}{z^3+3z^2+3z+1}. \]
	Now we can do the partial fraction decomposition on the second term. We can write it as
	\[ P(z) = \frac{z^2 + 2z + 1}{(z+1)^3} = \frac{A_0^{(1)}}{(z-1)^3} + 
	\frac{A_1^{(1)}}{(z-1)^2} + \frac{A_2^{(1)}}{(z-1)} \]
	Now by some linear algebra and solving the system of equations we will get
	\[ P(z) = \frac{1}{(z-1)^3} + 
	\frac{-1}{(z-1)^2} + \frac{1}{(z-1)}. \]
	Finally, we can write
	\[ F(z) = 2z + 1 +  \frac{1}{(z-1)^3} + 
	\frac{-1}{(z-1)^2} + \frac{1}{(z-1)}. \]
	Later, we will see that this is in fact the Laurent expansion of the function $F(z)$. 
\end{answer}

\begin{fact}[Trick For Partial Fraction Decomposition]
	We can do partial fraction decomposition in a more elegant way. Complex analysis is a place that geometry, analysis and algebra meet each other. As we replaced the algebraic operations in expanding a polynomial about an arbitrary point, by analysis and calculating the derivatives, there is no surprise that such a substitution is possible here as well. Also, we can see this blend of analysis and algebra as a hint that\textbf{ analysis has a very clean algebraic manifestation in the space of polynomials.  } The following example makes this link more clear. 
\end{fact}

\begin{exm}
	Do partial fraction decomposition for the following rational function.
	\[ F(z) = \frac{2z^4+7z^3+10z^2+6z+1}{z^3+3z^2+3z+1}. \]
\end{exm}

\begin{answer}
	As we saw in the question above,we can write  $F(z)$ as 
	\[ F(z) = 2z + 1 + \frac{z^2 + 2z + 1}{z^3+3z^2+3z+1}. \] 
	Denote the last term as
	\[ P(z) = \frac{z^2 + 2z + 1}{z^3+3z^2+3z+1} = \frac{z^2 + 2z + 1}{(z+1)^3}. \]
	Now the trick is as follows. Assume we have the partial fraction in the following from
	\[ P(z)  = \frac{A_0^{(1)}}{(z+1)^3} + \frac{A_1^{(1)}}{(z+1)^2} + \frac{A_2^{(1)}}{(z+1)}. \]
	Thus the problem is now to find the values of the coefficients. We can it easily by multiplying both sides at $(z+1)^3$. Then we will have
	\[ Q(z) = (z+1)^3 P(z) = A_0^{(1)} + A_1^{(1)} (z+1) + A_2^{(1)}(z+1)^2 .\]
	It immediately follows that 
	\begin{align*}
		A_0^{(1)} &= \lim_{z\to-1} Q(z), \\
		A_1^{(1)} &= \lim_{z\to-1} \frac{d}{dz} Q(z), \\
		A_1^{(2)} &= \lim_{z\to-1} \frac{1}{2!} \frac{d^2}{dz^2} Q(z).
	\end{align*}
	Note that we have used the notion of the limit in the above equations (instead of direct substitution) because $P(z)$ and thus $Q(z)$ is not defined at the point $z = -1$.

\begin{fact}
	If $P(z) = a_n (z-z_1)^{d_1} (z-z_2)^{d_2} \cdots (z-z_r)^{d_r}$, then the partial fraction expansion of the logarithmic derivative $P'/P$ is given by
	
	\[ \frac{P'(z)}{P(z)} = \frac{d_1}{z-z_1} + \frac{d_2}{z-z_2} + \cdots + \frac{d_r}{z-z_r}. \]
\end{fact}

	It immediately follows from the generalization of the derivative rule $(fgh)' = f'gh + fg'h + fgh'.$
