\chapter{Cauchy Theorem and Cauchy Integral Formula}

We start this chapter by the Goursat's theorem which in nutshell states that for a holomorphic function on an open region, it contour integral on a triangle contained in the open region is zero. We will use this idea later on to prove the Cauchy theorem.


\begin{theorem}[Goursat's theorem]
	Let $ \Omega \subset \C $ be an open set and $ T \subset \Omega $ be a triangle that its interior is also contained in $ \Omega $. Then 
	\[ \int_T f(z) dz = 0 \]
	whenever $ f $ is a holomorphic function on $ \Omega $.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	To see the proof, we will use the following argument. Consider the triangle below.
	\input{Images/trianglesForGoursat.tex}
	Starting with the triangle $ T^(0) $, we connect the mid-points of the edges and then we will get four \emph{congruent} triangles. By a simple geometrical argument we can see that the radius and the diameter of the triangles $ T^(1)_j $ for $ j=1,2,3,4 $ is half of the radius and perimeter of the original triangles. I.e. By doing the same process we will get smaller and smaller triangles at each step and at step $ n $ we have
	\[ d^(n) = 2^{-n} d^{(0)}, \qquad p^{n} = 2^{-n}p^{(0)}. \]
