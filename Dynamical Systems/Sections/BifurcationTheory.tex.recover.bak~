\section{Bifurcation Theory}

Here in this section we will explore the ideas of the bifurcation theory in the dynamical systems. This is a very important topic since it can give explanation for some sudden change that we see in the nature (for example the type I and type II phase transition in the thermodynamics). We will study them with the following classification.

\subsubsection{A Quick Review}
Consider the following family of dynamical systems parameterized by one parameter $\alpha$. 
\[ \dot{x} = f(x,\alpha), \]
where $f:\R \times \R \to \R$, and $x,\alpha \in \R$. And assume $f(x_0,\alpha_0)=0$, thus for $\alpha=\alpha_0$ the point $x_0$ is an equilibrium point. Now we can do the linearization at the equilibrium point and determine the type of stability. Thus after linearization we will have
\[ \dot{x} = f_x(x_0,\alpha_0) (x-x_0). \]
By letting $\xi = x - x_0$ we can now write
\[ \dot{\xi} = f_x(0,\alpha_0) \xi. \]
This is a very simple ODE whose solution is the exponential function. Thus we will have
\begin{align*}
	f_x(x_0,\alpha_0) &< 0 \implies \text{$x_0$ is stable}.\\
	f_x(x_0,\alpha_0) &> 0 \implies \text{$x_0$ is unstable}.\\
	f_x(x_0,\alpha_0) &=0 \implies \text{more terms from the Taylor's series is needed. } 
\end{align*}
Another way of seeing this is the following figure. Note that we can still determine the type of stability by looking at the graph, despite the fact that in the classification above we have said that in that case more terms from the Taylor's series is needed. The point is that when we are looking at the graph, we automatically infer the higher order terms of the Taylor's series as well and that is why we arrive at the right conclusion often.
\input{Images/review.tex}

It turns out that because of the smooth dependence of the function $f$ on both parameters, by sufficiently small enough perturbation of the parameter $\alpha$ from $\alpha_0$ the stability type of the equilibrium point will remain the same up to topological equivalence. For example in the figure below, the type of equilibrium point has remained the same (in this case stable equilibrium) with sufficiently small perturbation of parameter $\alpha$.

\input{Images/TopologicalTypeRemainsTheSame.tex}

However, when $f_x(x_0,\alpha_0) = 0$, then it is possible that any perturbation of parameter $\alpha$ leads to the emergence or disappearance of a new type of equilibrium point, in which we say we have a \emph{bifurcation}. 


\subsection{Intuitive Explanation of Bifurcation}
In this section we will cover the intuitive explanation behind the notion of bifurcation and different types, and the next section we will cover the theory behind it and discuss the topological normal forms.
\subsubsection{Fold (Saddle-Note) Bifurcation}
The fold bifurcation is one of the simple type bifurcations where a saddle and a node emerges from blue sky as we vary the parameter $\alpha$. Following the line of reasoning from the section above, assume $f(x,\alpha_0)$ looks like the following in the neighborhood of the point $x_0$.

\input{Images/IntuitiveFoldBifurcation.tex}

Then as we can clearly see, any small perturbation of $\alpha$ will lead ot emergence or disappearance of new equilibria out of blue sky. We can not intuitively say that the requirements for such a bifurcation is the followings
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item $f(x_0,\alpha_0) = 0$,
	\item $f_x(x_0,\alpha_0) = 0$,
	\item $f_\alpha(x_0, \alpha_0) \neq 0$,
	\item $f_{xx}(x_0,\alpha_0) = \neq 0$.
\end{enumerate}

It is also informative to look at the branching diagram on the $(\alpha-x)$ plane.

\input{Images/BranchingDiagramFoldBifurcation.tex}


\subsubsection{Transcritical Bifurcation}
Another possible way that the function $f(x,\alpha)$ might change in the neighborhood of $x_0$ is the following diagram.

\input{Images/TranscriticalBifurcation.tex}

We can observe that the $f(x,\alpha)$ has a form like $f(x,\alpha) = \alpha (x-x_0) - (x-x_0)^2$. We can see that two equilibria corresponding to $\alpha>\alpha_0$ turns into a saddle type equilibria when $\alpha = \alpha_0$ and then turn into two equilibria points for $\alpha<\alpha_0$. The following branching diagram summarizes this fact.

\input{Images/TranscriticalBranchingDaiagram.tex}

Again, we can intuitively say that the function $f(x,\alpha)$ should have the following conditions in order to exhibit a Transcritical bifurcation.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item $f(x_0,\alpha_0) = 0$,
	\item $f_x(x_0,\alpha_0) = 0$,
	\item $f_{xx}(x_0,\alpha_0) \neq  0$,
	\item $f_{\alpha x} (x_0,\alpha_0) \neq 0$.
\end{enumerate}
Note that $f_{\alpha x} = \frac{d}{d\alpha} \frac{df}{dx}$, which simply is the rate of change of the $x-$slope of $f(x,\alpha)$ with change in $\alpha$.

\subsubsection*{Theoretical Treatment of the Transcritical Bifurcation}
Consider the following family of vector fields
\[  \dot{x} = f(x,\alpha), \]
where $f:\R^1 \times \R^1 \to \R^1$. Furthermore suppose that the vector field is constrained in such a way that 
\[ f(0,\alpha) = 0, \]
for all $\alpha$ in some interval containing the special value $\alpha_0$. Also, assume that $(0,\alpha_0)$ is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium i.e.
\[ f_x(0,\alpha_0) = 0. \]
Thus there is a chance that we observe a bifurcation as we change the value of $\alpha$ through $\alpha_0$. Now we can expand the vector field around the point $(0,\alpha_0)$. 
\begin{align*}
	f(x,\alpha) &= \underbrace{f(0,\alpha)}_{=0} + f_x(0,\alpha)x + 1/2 f_x(0,\alpha) x^2 + \order{\abs{x}^3} \\
	&= x(f_x(0,\alpha) + f_{xx}(0,\alpha)x/2 + \order{\abs{x}^2})= x\hat{f}(x,\alpha).
\end{align*}
Now in this representation of the vector field, it is clear that due to the constraint that $f(0,\alpha)=0$, $x=p^0_1(\alpha)\equiv0$ is a branch of equilibria. The other branch can be computed by setting $\hat{f}(x,\alpha)=0$. Before doing that, we need to expand the $\hat{f}(x,\alpha)$ in $x$ as well. Thus
\[ \hat{f}(x,\alpha) = \underbrace{f_x(0,\alpha_0)}_{=0} + \underbrace{f_{x\alpha}(0,\alpha_0)}_{a}(\alpha-\alpha_0)
						+ \underbrace{1/2f_{xx}(0,\alpha_0)}_{b} x 
						+ \order{\abs{\alpha-\alpha_0}^2 + \abs{\alpha-\alpha_0}\abs{x} + \abs{x}^2}  \]
In short, we can write the vector field as
\[ f(x,\alpha) = x (a(\alpha-\alpha_0) + bx + \order{\abs{\alpha-\alpha_0}^2 + \abs{\alpha-\alpha_0}\abs{x} + \abs{x}^2}  ) \]
We require to more conditions in order to have the transcritical bifurcation, i.e. $a\neq0$ and $b\neq0$.  So, now we can easily solve $\hat{f}(x,\alpha)=0$ locally to get the second branch of equilibrium locally. We can do it fancy and use the fact that $\hat{f}_x(x,\alpha)  b = \neq 0$ and also $\hat{f}(0,\alpha_0) = 0$, to obtain a locally smooth function $x = g(\alpha)$ on which $\hat{f}(g(\alpha),\alpha) = 0$, and then using the Taylor expansion of $g(\alpha) = c_0 + c_1\alpha + c_2\alpha^2+\cdots$, and pluging it in in the equation $\hat{f}(g(\alpha),\alpha) = 0$ we can get the coefficients. However, a much more simpler way is to simply ignore the higher order terms in $\hat{f}(x,\alpha)$ and get $x$ in terms of $\alpha$ which will be $x = \frac{-a}{b}(\alpha-\alpha_0)$. This defines the second branch of equilibrium. To determine the stability of the equilibria branches, we need to determine the the sign of the vector field. The following figure shows this procedure for $a>0$ and $b<0$ case
\input{Images/TranscriticalBifurcationTheory.tex}

\subsubsection*{General Transcritical Bifurcation}
Consider the following family of vector fields
\[ \dot{x} = f(x,\alpha) \]
where $f:\R^1 \times \R^1 \to \R^1$. Furthermore, assume that the vector field is constrained to be zero on the smooth curve $p^0_1(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha$ in some interval containing the special value $\alpha_0$ and $p_1^0(\alpha_0) = 0$. I.e.
\[ f(p_1^0(\alpha),\alpha) = 0, \quad \text{for all $\alpha$ in some interval containing $\alpha_0$}. \]
In addition, assume that the point $(0,\alpha_0)$ is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point, i.e.
\[ f_x(0,\alpha_0) = 0. \]
In this case, there is a chance that we observe a bifurcation, as it is possible that the linearization change sign as we pass $\alpha$ through $\alpha_0$. To analyze the system further, we do the following change of variable
\[ x = p^0_1(\alpha) + u. \]
By substituting in the ODE for $x$ and expanding it we will get
\[ \dot{x} = f(p^0_1(\alpha)+u,\alpha) = \underbrace{f(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha)}_{=0} + \underbrace{f_x(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha)}_{\lambda(\alpha)}u + \underbrace{1/2f_{xx}(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha)}_{\underbrace{1/2f_{xx}(p^0_1(\alpha_0),\alpha_0)}_b + \order{\abs{\alpha-\alpha_0}}} u^2 + \order{\abs{u}^3}. \]
And by expanding $\lambda(\alpha)$ we will get
\[ \lambda(\alpha) = \underbrace{\lambda(\alpha_0)}_{=0} + \lambda'(\alpha_0)(\alpha-\alpha_0) + \order{\abs{\alpha-\alpha_0}^2}. \]
Furthermore, to have the transcritical bifurcation, we require $a = \lambda'(\alpha_0)  \neq 0$, and by the chain rule, we can get a much more simpler expression for $\lambda'(\alpha_0)$
\[ a = \lambda'(\alpha_0)  = \frac{d}{d\alpha} f_x(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha) \big|_{\alpha=\alpha_0} = \underbrace{f_{xx}(0,\alpha_0)}_{2b}(p_1^0)'(\alpha_0) + f_{x\alpha}(0,\alpha_0) \neq 0.  \]
Note that $(p^0_1)'(\alpha_0)$ is know to us because $p^0_1(\alpha_0)$ is already given (this is the smooth curve on which the vector field is constrained to be zero). Also, $a\neq0$ means that the value of $\lambda(\alpha)$ crosses $\lambda(\alpha_0) = 0$ transversally.


\subsubsection{Pitchfork Bifurcation}
In the pitchfork bifurcation, a stable equilibrium point turns into two stable equilibrium points separated by an unstable equilibrium point (in the case of the super-critical one). In this bifurcation, the vector field changes as depicted by the following figure.
\input{Images/pitchForkBifurcationFunctionChange.tex}

The dependence of $f(x,\alpha)$ on the variable $(x,\alpha)$ has the form $f(x,\alpha) = \xi_\alpha \xi_x - \xi_x^3$, where $\xi_\alpha = \alpha - \alpha_0$ and $\xi_x = x - x_0$.

Also, the following figure shows that branching diagram for the pitchfork bifurcation.
\input{Images/pitchForkBranchingDiagram.tex}

Again, we can intuitively figure out what conditions the functions $f(x,\alpha)$ should satisfy in order to have this kind of bifurcation.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item $f(x-x_0,\alpha)$ be locally odd (in the neighborhood of $x_0$) with respect to $x$, i.e. $f(-(x-x_0),\alpha) = - f(x-x_0,\alpha)$ and $f(x_0,\alpha_0) =0 $. The local oddness also leads to 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item $f(x_0,\alpha) = 0$,
		\item $f_{xx}(x,\alpha)=0$, as well as any other even derivative.
	\end{enumerate} 
	\item $f_x(x_0,\alpha_0) =0$,
	\item $f_{xxx}(x_0,\alpha_0) \neq 0$,
	\item $f_{\alpha x} (x_0,\alpha_0) \neq 0$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{More Theoretical Treatment of the Pitchfork Bifurcation}
In this section we will derive the results above in a more analytic way. Assume we have the following family dynamical systems
\[ \dot{x} = f(x,\alpha) \]
where $f:\R^1 \times \R^1 \to \R^1$. Also assume that the vector field $f$ is odd with respect to $x$. I.e.
\[ f(-x,\alpha) = -f(x,\alpha). \]
This will immediately lead to 
\[ f(0,\alpha) = 0,\ f_{xx}(0,\alpha) = 0,\ f_{xxxx}(0,\alpha) = 0,\ \cdots. \]
Also, assume that for the special value of $\alpha = \alpha_0$ we have
\[ f_x(0,\alpha_0) = 0. \]
In this case, there is a chance that we have a bifurcation (since changing the value of $\alpha$ through $\alpha_0$ might change the sign of $f_x(0,\alpha)$ which will lead to a bifurcation.) Now we can expand the vector field around the bifurcation point as follows
\[ f(x,\alpha) = \underbrace{f(0,\alpha)}_{=0} + \underbrace{f_x(0,\alpha)}_{=f_{x}(0,\alpha_0) + f_{x\alpha}(0,\alpha_0)(\alpha - \alpha_0)+\cdots}x + 1/6\underbrace{f_{xxx}(0,\alpha)}_{=f_{xxx}(0,\alpha_0)+\cdots}x^3 + \mathcal{O}(\abs{x^5}) \]
Now let $a = f_{x\alpha}(0,\alpha_0) \neq 0 $ and $b = 1/6 f_{xxx}(0,\alpha_0) \neq 0$. So the vector field can be written like
\[ f(x,\alpha) = a(\alpha-\alpha_0)x + bx^3 + \cdots = x (a(\alpha-\alpha_0)+bx^2 + \cdots)=  x\hat{f}(x,\alpha), \]
in which the higher order terms do not change the topological behaviour. Also, from this expression of the vector field, it is clear that $x=0$ is a branch of equilibria. We can find the other branch by letting $\hat{f}(x,\alpha) = 0$. We can do so by ignoring all of higher order terms and solve $x$ in terms of $\alpha$ and find the second branch of equilibria. However, we want to be fancy and use implicit function theorem! It is clear from the expression for $\hat{f}(x,\alpha)$ that $\hat{f}_\alpha(0,\alpha_0) = a \neq 0$. Thus we can write $\alpha = g(x)$ where $g(0) =\alpha_0$ and also $\hat{f}(x,g(x)) = 0$ for $\alpha$ belonging to some interval containing the special value $\alpha_0$. We can do such by the implicit function theorem. The implicit function theorem also states that the function $g$ is smooth. Thus we can write its Taylor expansion as follows
\[ g(x) =\underbrace{ g(0)}_{=\alpha_0} + \underbrace{g'(0)}_{=c_1}x + \underbrace{g''(0)/2}_{=c_2}x^2+ \mathcal{O}(\abs{x}^3). \]
We can substitute the expression above in $\hat{f}(x,g(x)) = a(g(x)-\alpha_0) + bx^2 + \cdots = 0$, and find the coefficients $c_i$. By doing so we will find
\[ a(c_1x + c_2x^2 + \cdots) + bx^2 = 0 \implies c_1 = 0,\quad c_2 = \frac{-b}{a}, \cdots. \]
Thus the expression for $g(x)$ will be
\[ \alpha = g(x) = \alpha_0 + \frac{-b}{a}x^2 . \]
All of this trouble was to be fancy and solve $\hat{f}(x,\alpha)=0$. The simpler way is to simply ignore the higher order terms in $\hat{f}(x,\alpha)$ and solve the equation $\hat{f}(x,\alpha)=0$. I.e.
\[ \hat{f}(x,\alpha) \approx a(\alpha-\alpha_0) + bx^2 \implies \alpha = \alpha_0 -\frac{b}{a} x^2. \]
This will define the second branch of equilibria. The next step is to determine the stability of these equilibrium points that can be done by determining the sign of the vector field around the equilibrium branches. For instance, fix $b<0$ and $a>0$. Then we will have
\input{Images/PitchForkBifurcation.tex}

Note that the vertical axis represents $x$ while the horizontal axis represents $\alpha$. We can do the same kind of analysis on the sign of the vector field when $a$ and $b$ has other combination of signs.

\subsubsection*{Generalized Pitchfork Bifurcation}
Consider the following family of vector fields
\[ \dot{x} = f(x,\alpha), \]
where $f: \R^1 \times \R^1 \to \R^1$. Also, assume that the vector field is constrained in such a way that on $p^0_1(\alpha)$, where $0 = p^0_1(\alpha_0)$, we have
\[ f(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha) = 0,\quad f_{xx}(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha) = 0, \]
for all $\alpha$ in some interval containing the special value $\alpha_0$. Thus, clearly $(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha)$ is a branch of equilibrium, and in particular, $(0,\alpha_0)$ is an equilibrium point on this branch. Furthermore, assume that 
\[ f_x(0,\alpha_0) = 0, \] 
which implies that $(0,\alpha_0)$ is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point. Thus there is a chance that we observe a bifurcation as we pass the value of $\alpha$ through $\alpha_0$. To analyze the system we use the following coordinate change.
\[ x = p^0_1(\alpha) + u. \]
Substituting in the ODE for $x$ we will have
\[ (p^0_1)'(\alpha)\dot{\alpha} + \dot{u} = f(p^0_1(\alpha) + u,\alpha).\]
Now we can expand the vector field as
\[ \dot{u} = \underbrace{f(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha)}_{=0} + \underbrace{f_x(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha)}_{\lambda(\alpha)}u + \underbrace{f_{xx}(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha)}_{=0}u^2/2 + f_{xxx}(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha)u^3/6 + \order{\abs{u}^4}. \]
Thus in short we will have
\[ \dot{u} = \lambda(\alpha)u + \frac{1}{6}\underbrace{f_{xxx}(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha)}_{f_{xxx}(0,\alpha_0) + \order{\alpha-\alpha_0}} u^3 + \order{\abs{u}^4}. \]
We require $b = 1/6 f_{xxx}(0,\alpha_0) \neq 0$. Also, we can expand $\lambda(\alpha)$ as
\[ \lambda(\alpha) = \underbrace{\lambda(\alpha_0)}_{f_x(0,\alpha_0)=0} + \lambda'(\alpha_0)(\alpha-\alpha_0) + \order{\abs{\alpha-\alpha_0}^2}. \]
Further more, we require $a  = \lambda'(\alpha_0) \neq  0$. By the chain rule we can write
\[  a = \lambda'(\alpha_0) = \frac{d}{d\alpha} f_x(p^0_1(\alpha),\alpha) \big|_{\alpha=\alpha_0} = \underbrace{f_{xx}(0,\alpha_0)}_{=0}(p^0_1)'(\alpha_0) + f_{x\alpha}(0,\alpha_0).  \] 
By these conditions ($a \neq 0$ and $b\neq 0$) we will have the simplified vector field as
\[ \dot{u} = a(\alpha - \alpha_0) u + bu^3 + \order{\abs{u}^4} \]

Thus as we can see, even in the generalized setting for the Pitchfork bifurcation, by the use of appropriate change of coordinates, we can still write the vector field very similar to the case where the vector field was a symmetric function.

\subsubsection{Some General Notes about Pitchfork Bifurcation}
The pitchfork bifurcation is a very important bifurcation as it appears in many systems, and even more important than that, it is the bifurcation lying behind other bifurcations like the Hopf bifurcation, flop (period doubling bifurcation) for maps, etc. In fact, for the Hopf bifurcation we have
\[  
\begin{cases}
	\dot{r}=a\alpha r + br^3,\\
	\dot{\theta} = w.
\end{cases}
\]
And for the period doubling bifurcation for maps, the normal form of the second iterate map is
\[ y \mapsto y + a\alpha y + by^3.\]
In all of these situations, the curve $a\alpha y + by^3$ is crossing ``something'' in one way or another. The following figure makes this more clear. Further more, the interesting fact is that we can actually get the normal form of the pitchfork bifurcation by simply integrating (with respect to $x$) of the normal form of the fold bifurcation.

\section{Local Bifurcation Theory for Maps}
In this section we will develop our theory to study the bifurcation for the maps.

\subsection{Flip or Period Doubling Bifurcation}
Consider the following family of maps
\[ x \mapsto f(x,\alpha) \]
where $x \in \R^1,\ \alpha \in \R^1$, and $f: \R^1\times\R^1 \to \R$ is a smooth vector family of vector fields. Assume that at $(p^0_0, \alpha_0)$ we have
\[ f(p_0^0, \alpha_0) = p_0^0, \qquad f_x(p_0^0, \alpha_0) = -1. \]
This means that the point $p_0^0$ is an equilibrium point that is non-hyperbolic. Then there is a high chance that some bifurcation is going to happen (since $f_x(p^0_0,\alpha_0)=-1)$). First, notice that there is a smooth branch of equilibria containing $p_0^0$. To show this, let $G(x,\alpha) = f(x,\alpha) - x$. Then it immediately follows that $G(p_0^0, \alpha_0) = 0$ and $G_x(p_0^0,\alpha_0) = -2 \neq 0$. Thus using the implicit function theorem, we can write $x = p^0(\alpha)$, where $p_0^0 = p^0(\alpha_0)$. Furthermore, we have
\[ f(p^0(\alpha),\alpha) = p^0(\alpha) \]
since $p^0(\alpha)$ is actually a branch of equilibria. To determine the behavior of the system near the equilibrium points, we can do the following change of variable
\[ x = p^0(\alpha) + u. \]
By substituting the equation above in the recursive form of the map we will get
\begin{align*}
	p^0(\alpha) + u_{k+1} &= f(p^0(\alpha)+u,\alpha) \\
	&= \underbrace{f(p^0(\alpha),\alpha)}_{p^0(\alpha)} + \underbrace{f_x(p^0(\alpha),\alpha)}_{\mu(\alpha)}u_k + \underbrace{1/2f_{xx}(p^0(\alpha),\alpha)}_{\hat{f}_2(\alpha)}u_k^2 + \underbrace{1/6f_{xxx}(p^0(\alpha),\alpha)}_{\hat{f}_3(\alpha)}u_k^3 + \mathcal{O}(\abs{u_k}^4).
\end{align*}
So we can now write the map as
\[ u \mapsto \mu(\alpha)u + \hat{f}_2(\alpha)u^2 + \hat{f}_3(\alpha)u^3 + \mathcal{O}(\abs{u}^4). \]
First, notice that, in order to have the bifurcation, the value of $\mu(\alpha)$ should cross $-1$ at $\alpha_0$ transversally (i.e. have values other than $-1$ at the points arbitrary close to $\alpha_0$). Thus we need to have $-a = \mu'(\alpha_0) \neq 0$. The next step is a very crucial one. The following example makes this step much more sensible.

\begin{example}
	Let $f(x) = x+ax^{2}+bx^{3}+cx^{4}$ where $a=-2.6, b=6.8$, and $c=-10$. Define a new identity non-linear transformation as 
	\[ x = y+dy^{2}+gy^{3}+hy^{4}+jy^{5}+ky^{6}+ly^{7}+my^{8}. \]
	Find the coefficients of the transformation such that $f(y)$ has zero or small coefficients for the terms with lower order. 
	
	\begin{ans}
		To find the answer, we simply substitute the transformation into $f(x)$ and then find the coefficients such that the terms with lower order (lower powers) be zero or be minimum. We can do so using symbolic tools in python or other programming languages. The final results for the coefficients will be
		\[ d=2.6,\ g=6.72,\ h=9.48,\ j=−30.8,\ k=−266.1,\ l=−515.2,\ m=5619.4  \]
		
		And the expression for $f(z)$ will be
		\begin{align*}
			f(z) = & -9.9718 \times 10^{15} z^{32} + 3.6575 \times 10^{15} z^{31} + 1.3862 \times 10^{15} z^{30} \\
			& - 2.7004 \times 10^{11} z^{29} - 2.1478 \times 10^{11} z^{28} - 3.1614 \times 10^{10} z^{27} \\
			& + 9.3739 \times 10^{9} z^{26} + 4.1132 \times 10^{9} z^{25} + 4.1196 \times 10^{9} z^{24} \\
			& - 3.6990 \times 10^{8} z^{23} - 5.1383 \times 10^{8} z^{22} - 1.0269 \times 10^{8} z^{21} \\
			& + 1.1804 \times 10^{7} z^{20} + 1.1487 \times 10^{7} z^{19} + 2.9077 \times 10^{6} z^{18} \\
			& + 4.9065 \times 10^{5} z^{17} - 4.7806 \times 10^{5} z^{16} - 1.2066 \times 10^{5} z^{15} \\
			& - 3.7331 \times 10^{3} z^{14} + 5.7317 \times 10^{3} z^{13} + 1.8873 \times 10^{3} z^{12} \\
			& + 239.716 z^{11} - 46.1615 z^{10} - 66.1136 z^{9} + z.
		\end{align*}
		In the figure below, we can easily see that the $f(y)$ is much more linear than $f(x)$ near the origin. 
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Images/NearIdentityTransformation.png}
		\end{center}
	\end{ans}
\end{example}

Back to our business with the map we were analyzing that now look like this:
\[ u \mapsto \mu(\alpha)u + \hat{f}_2(\alpha)u^2 + \hat{f}_3(\alpha)u^3 + \mathcal{O}(\abs{u}^4). \]
We do the following transformation
\[ u = v + h_2(\alpha) v^2. \]
Now we substitute the expression for $u$ and try to choose $h_2(\alpha)$ in a way that makes the coefficient of $v^2$ zero or very small. By substituting we will have
\[ v_{k+1} + h_2(\alpha)v_{k+1}^2 = \mu(\alpha)(v_k+h_2(\alpha)v_k^2) + \hat{f}_2(\alpha)(v_k+h_2(\alpha)v_k^2)^2 + \hat{f}_3(\alpha)(v_k+h_2(\alpha)v_k^2)^3 + \cdots. \]
(assume $v_{k+1} = \mu(\alpha)v_k + \cdots$ to the leading order. I don't know the reason yet but I will update the notes as soon as I notice.) Then we can write
\begin{align*}
	 v_{k+1} = \mu(\alpha)v_k + (\mu(\alpha)h_2(\alpha) + \hat{f}_2(\alpha)-h_2(\alpha)\mu^2(\alpha))v_k^2 + (2\hat{f}_2(\alpha)h_2(\alpha)+\hat{f}_3(\alpha))v_k^3 + \cdots. 
\end{align*}
Thus simply by letting
\[ h_2(\alpha) = \frac{\hat{f}_2(\alpha)}{\mu^2(\alpha)-\mu(\alpha)} \]
the coefficient of $v_k^2$ will be zero and the map will transform into
\[ v \mapsto \mu(\alpha)v + g_3(\alpha)v^3 + \mathcal{O}(\abs{v}^4), \]
where $-b = g_3(\alpha_0) = [\hat{f}_2(\alpha_0)]^2 + \hat{f}_3(\alpha_0)$. Now expanding the map around $\alpha_0$ will result in 
\[ v \mapsto -(1+a(\alpha-\alpha_0))v + g_3(\alpha_0)v^3 + \mathcal{O}(\abs{v}^4 + \abs{\alpha-\alpha_0}^2\abs{v} + \abs{\alpha-\alpha_0}\abs{v}^3).   \]
In short, the vector field will be
\[ v \mapsto -v - a\beta v - bv^3 + \cdots, \]
where we used the transformation $\alpha = \beta + \alpha_0$.


\section{Poincare Normal Form and Projection Method}
The nonlinear close to identity transformation that we did above, is make the vector field more linear close to the origin and make the lower order coefficients of the expansion around the origin to be as small as possible. Note that all of the nonlinear close to identity transformations are one-to-one when we are sufficiently near the origin. Thus the transformation has inverse, from which we can retrieve the original values.

The nature of the non-linear close to identity transformation is quite messy. Thus we need to develop some theoretical setting in order to handle the mess of it. There are two ways to do that: Poincare-Birkhoff
