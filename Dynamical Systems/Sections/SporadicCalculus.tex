\section{Sporadic Calculus}

In this section I will cover the basics of calculus which I have used throughout the text. 

\subsection{Level Curves}
Here, I will focus my arguments to 2D scalar function and vector fields, as it is easier to imagine and also plot. However, it can easily been generalized to higher dimensions. 

Let $F: \R^2 \to \R$ be a function. This function is called a scalar function, as it assigns an scalar value to each point in the $\R^2$ plane.
