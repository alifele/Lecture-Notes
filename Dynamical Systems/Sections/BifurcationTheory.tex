\section{Bifurcation Theory}

Here in this section we will explore the ideas of the bifurcation theory in the dynamical systems. This is a very important topic since it can give explanation for some sudden change that we see in the nature (for example the type I and type II phase transition in the thermodynamics). We will study them with the following classification.

\subsubsection{A Quick Review}
Consider the following family of dynamical systems parameterized by one parameter $\alpha$. 
\[ \dot{x} = f(x,\alpha), \]
where $f:\R \times \R \to \R$, and $x,\alpha \in \R$. And assume $f(x_0,\alpha_0)=0$, thus for $\alpha=\alpha_0$ the point $x_0$ is an equilibrium point. Now we can do the linearization at the equilibrium point and determine the type of stability. Thus after linearization we will have
\[ \dot{x} = f_x(x_0,\alpha_0) (x-x_0). \]
By letting $\xi = x - x_0$ we can now write
\[ \dot{\xi} = f_x(0,\alpha_0) \xi. \]
This is a very simple ODE whose solution is the exponential function. Thus we will have
\begin{align*}
	f_x(0,\alpha_0) < 0 \implies \text{$x_0$ is stable}.\\
	f_x(0,\alpha_0) > 0 \implies \text{$x_0$ is unstable}.
\end{align*}
Another way of seeing this is the following figure
