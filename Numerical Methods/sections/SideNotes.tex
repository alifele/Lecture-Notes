\section{Errors in the book ``Finite Difference Computing with PDEs'' by Hans Petter}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Equation (3.29): The forcing term is not present (maybe they have somehow assumes that this is zero but according to (3.40) this is unlikely).
	\item Equation (3.31): The forcing terms has no $ \Delta t $ coefficient.
	\item Equation (3.40): Comparing this with equation (3.31) reveals that the right hand side is not correct.
	\item Section (3.3.7): The very first equation in this section. $ Dxu $ should read $ D_x u $
	\item Page 256: I would prefer to see the more standard notation for the ``mapsto'' which is $ (0,0) \mapsto 0 $ instead of simple arrow.
	\item Equation (3.92): The right hand side should be $ 1 + 2\theta (F_x+F_y) $.
	\item The matrix at the bottom of the page 257: On the main diagonal, the elements that are not 1 are wrong. They should be $ 1 + 2\theta(F_x+F_y) $.
	\item Page 332: The equation second from the end, is missing a left bracket.
	\item Part 4.1.6: In the third equation, in RHS, $ \partial u/\partial t $ should be $ \partial/\partial t $.
