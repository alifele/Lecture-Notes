\section{Errors in the book ``Finite Difference Computing with PDEs'' by Hans Petter}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Equation (3.29): The forcing term is not present (maybe they have somehow assumes that this is zero but according to (3.40) this is unlikely).
	\item Equation (3.31): The forcing terms has no $ \Delta t $ coefficient.
	\item Equation (3.40): Comparing this with equation (3.31) reveals that the right hand side is not correct.
