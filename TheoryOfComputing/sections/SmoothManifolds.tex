\section{Problems}
\begin{problem}
	Let $ X $ ge the set of all points $ (x,y) \in \R^2 $ such that $ y = \pm 1 $, and let $ M $ be the quotient of $ X $ be the equivalence relation generated by $ (x,-1) \sim (x,1) $ for all $ x\neq 0 $. Show that $ M $ is locally Euclidean and second countable, but not Hausdorff. This space is called the line with two origins.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	Denote the topological space $ Y = X/\sim $. The open sets in $ Y $ are those that their pre-image under the quotient map $ \pi: X \mapsto X/\sim $ is open. Denote the open sets around the origins as $ I, I_+ $, and $ I_- $, where $ \pi((0,-1)) \in I_- $, $ \pi((0,1))\in I_+ $, and bot holds for $ I $.
