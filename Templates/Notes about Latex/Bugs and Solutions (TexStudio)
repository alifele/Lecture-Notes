When you open a new file in tex studio, the syntax color high light do not work properly. To resolve that you need to open all of the files including the *.sty file. Set the main file as the root file (from the options menu) and compile the document once. Then you need to close the session and open it again. Note that if you do not set the main file as root, the syntax highlighting will still not working.
