\section{Induction and well ordering}

Here in this section I will go through some topics in modular arithmetic which are the basis for more complicated stuff in the later chapters. Let's begin with the well ordering axiom.

\begin{defbox}{Well Ordering Axiom}
	Well Ordering Axiom: Let $ S $ be a set. We say this set is well ordered if for each subset of it, we can find a smallest element in that subset. 
\end{defbox}

At first this might sound obvious. But with this definition the set $ \mathbb{R}^{+} $ is not a well ordered set. But the set of natural integers $ \mathbb{N} $ is indeed a well ordered set.
