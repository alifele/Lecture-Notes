\section{2023-Feb-16 Meeting: Mathematical Biology: Understanding Form and Function in Vascular Tumors}



\subsection{Biology Background}
Tumor vessels in tumors and 

Grow rapidly - Leaky - Prone to Colapse - The architecture is highly irregular : So the blood supply is different


Research Question: How to quantify this irregularity? put some numbers to it? How does the treatment alters the blood flow?

Low oxygen level: disrupts the cell cycle so alter chemotherapy and radiotherapy responses and enhances metastasis

Types of Hypoxia: Chronic Hypoxia - Cycling Hypoxia. What is the mechanism behind that? Can any of these types of hypoxia be used to our advantage?

Characterising vascular networks: Statistical Metrics (vessle length, diameters, branching angles ). DownSide: It focus on a single spatial scale. The question is can we quantify the form in a multiscalse sense?



\subsection{Topological data analysis}
The hiddens shapes in the data. Like a cloud of data points that resembles a torus. Persistent Homology --> the idea of inlating the disks centered on the data points.


\subsection{Relating "Form" to "Function"}
How does the architecture influence the blood flow in the network?
