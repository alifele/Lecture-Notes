	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item In example 2.1.11 L\"{o}h, we discuss the notion of the isometry groups. One good example for such group is the group of unitary matrices. The reason is that these matrices preserve the inner product, and hence the norm induced by the inner product. Indeed $ \inv{U} = U\dagger $, so
		\[ \norm{U a} = \langle Ua, Ua \rangle^{1/2} = \langle UU^\dagger a, a\rangle^{1/2} = \langle a,a \rangle =  \norm{a}. \]
		
		
		\item Dihedral group is the symmetry group (isometry group) of regular polygon. A bit of interpretation is needed to clarify we mean here. When we say, the symmetry group of a regular polygon, implicitly, we consider the regular polygon as a metric space. And one natural question is, what is the metric? We can let the metric be the one inherited by restricting the Euclidean metric to the polygon (assuming it is embedded in $ \R^n $), or we can use other notions of metric, like the word metric (i.e. minimum number of edges between two nodes of interest).
