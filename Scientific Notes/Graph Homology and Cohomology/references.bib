  abstract  = {Already an international bestseller, with the release of this greatly enhanced second edition, Graph Theory and Its Applications is now an even better choice as a textbook for a variety of courses -- a textbook that will continue to serve your students as a reference for years to come.The superior explanations, broad coverage, and abundance of illustrations and exercises that positioned this as the premier graph theory text remain, but are now augmented by a broad range of improvements. Nearly 200 pages have been added for this edition, including nine new sections and hundreds of new exercises, mostly non-routine. What else is new?New chapters on measurement and analytic graph theory Supplementary exercises in each chapter - ideal for reinforcing, reviewing, and testing.Solutions and hints, often illustrated with figures, to selected exercises - nearly 50 pages worthReorganization and extensive revisions in more than half of the existing chapters for smoother flow of the expositionForeshadowing - the first three chapters now preview a number of concepts, mostly via the exercises, to pique the interest of readerGross and Yellen take a comprehensive approach to graph theory that integrates careful exposition of classical developments with emerging methods, models, and practical needs. Their unparalleled treatment provides a text ideal for a two-semester course and a variety of one-semester classes, from an introductory one-semester course to courses slanted toward classical graph theory, operations research, data structures and algorithms, or algebra and topology.},

  abstract     = {This is an elementary introduction to the Hodge Laplacian on a graph, a higher-order generalization of the graph Laplacian. We will discuss basic properties including cohomology and Hodge theory. The main feature of our approach is simplicity, requiring only knowledge of linear algebra and graph theory. We have also isolated the algebra from the topology to show that a large part of cohomology and Hodge theory is nothing more than the linear algebra of matrices satisfying \$AB = 0\$. For the remaining topological aspect, we cast our discussions entirely in terms of graphs as opposed to less-familiar topological objects like simplicial complexes.},

  title     = {Graph homology},
  year      = {2024},
  abstract  = {In algebraic topology and graph theory, graph homology describes the homology groups of a graph, where the graph is considered as a topological space. It formalizes the idea of the number of "holes" in the graph. It is a special case of a simplicial homology, as a graph is a special case of a simplicial complex. Since a finite graph is a 1-complex (i.e., its 'faces' are the vertices - which are 0-dimensional, and the edges - which are 1-dimensional), the only non-trivial homology groups are the 0-th group and the 1-th group.},
