  abstract   = {The proliferation and metastatic spread of tumor cells depend on the newly developed blood vessels. Vasculature not only provides an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients but also removes waste products or gas exchange. The process of angiogenesis is controlled by various transcriptional factors and growth factors. It has been observed that the discovery of angiogenic inhibitors can help to reduce carcinomas growth. Presently, chemotherapeutic drugs mediated inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), which initiates neovascularization under hypoxic conditions in the tumor, is being investigated. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and receptor VEGFR mediated activation of endothelial cells are also inhibited by chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, chemotherapeutic drugs inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways mediated growth of new blood vessels. The aim of this chapter would be to highlight the role of angiogenesis in cancer progression. Furthermore, various anti-cancer therapeutic strategies/trials based upon inhibition of blood vessels would also be discussed.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature, is a process whereby capillary sprouts are formed in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial-cell migration, and organize themselves into a dendritic structure. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout tip permits further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumors. In this paper we present both continuous and discrete mathematical models which describe the formation of the capillary sprout network in response to chemical stimuli (tumor angiogenic factors, TAF) supplied by a solid tumor. The models also take into account essential endothelial cell-extracellular matrix interactions via the inclusion of the matrix macromolecule fibronectin. The continuous model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the initial migratory response of endothelial cells to the TAF and the fibronectin. Numerical simulations of the system, using parameter values based on experimental data, are presented and compared qualitatively with in vivo experiments. We then use a discretized form of the partial differential equations to develop a biased random-walk model which enables us to track individual endothelial cells at the sprout tips and incorporate anastomosis, mitosis and branching explicitly into the model. The theoretical capillary networks generated by computer simulations of the discrete model are compared with the morphology of capillary networks observed in in vivo experiments.},

  abstract = {Angiogenesis is the process by which blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels. It plays a key role in many biological processes, including embryonic development and wound healing, and contributes to many diseases including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The structure of the resulting vessel networks determines their ability to deliver nutrients and remove waste products from biological tissues. Here we simulate the Anderson-Chaplain model of angiogenesis at different parameter values and quantify the vessel architectures of the resulting synthetic data. Specifically, we propose a topological data analysis (TDA) pipeline for systematic analysis of the model. TDA is a vibrant and relatively new field of computational mathematics for studying the shape of data. We compute topological and standard descriptors of model simulations generated by different parameter values. We show that TDA of model simulation data stratifies parameter space into regions with similar vessel morphology. The methodologies proposed here are widely applicable to other synthetic and experimental data including wound healing, development, and plant biology., Vascular networks play a key role in many physiological processes, by delivering nutrition to, and removing waste from, biological tissues. In cancer, tumors stimulate the growth of new blood vessels, via a process called angiogenesis. The resulting vascular structure comprises many inter-connected vessels which lead to emergent morphologies that influence the rate of tumor growth and treatment efficacy. In this work, we consider several approaches to summarize the morphology of synthetic vascular networks generated from a mathematical model of tumor-induced angiogenesis. We find that a topological approach can be used quantify vascular morphology of model simulations and group the simulations into biologically interpretable clusters. This methodology may be useful for the diagnosis of abnormal blood vessel networks and quantifying the efficacy of vascular-targeting treatments.},

  abstract = {The morphogenesis of branched organs remains a subject of abiding interest. Although much is known about the underlying signaling pathways, it remains unclear how macroscopic features of branched organs, including their size, network topology, and spatial patterning, are encoded. Here, we show that, in mouse mammary gland, kidney, and human prostate, these features can be explained quantitatively within a single unifying framework of branching and annihilating random walks. Based on quantitative analyses of large-scale organ reconstructions and proliferation kinetics measurements, we propose that morphogenesis follows from the proliferative activity of equipotent tips that stochastically branch and randomly explore their environment but compete neutrally for space, becoming proliferatively inactive when in proximity with neighboring ducts. These results show that complex branched epithelial structures develop as a self-organized process, reliant upon a strikingly simple but generic rule, without recourse to a rigid and deterministic sequence of genetically programmed events.},

  abstract = {Branching morphogenesis governs the formation of many organs such as lung, kidney, and the neurovascular system. Many studies have explored system-specific molecular and cellular regulatory mechanisms, as well as self-organizing rules underlying branching morphogenesis. However, in addition to local cues, branched tissue growth can also be influenced by global guidance. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for a stochastic self-organized branching process in the presence of external cues. Combining analytical theory with numerical simulations, we predict differential signatures of global vs. local regulatory mechanisms on the branching pattern, such as angle distributions, domain size, and space-filling efficiency. We find that branch alignment follows a generic scaling law determined by the strength of global guidance, while local interactions influence the tissue density but not its overall territory. Finally, using zebrafish innervation as a model system, we test these key features of the model experimentally. Our work thus provides quantitative predictions to disentangle the role of different types of cues in shaping branched structures across scales.},

  abstract = {Branching morphogenesis is a ubiquitous process that gives rise to high exchange surfaces in the vasculature and epithelial organs. Lymphatic capillaries form branched networks, which play a key role in the circulation of tissue fluid and immune cells. Although mouse models and correlative patient data indicate that the lymphatic capillary density directly correlates with functional output, i.e., tissue fluid drainage and trafficking efficiency of dendritic cells, the mechanisms ensuring efficient tissue coverage remain poorly understood. Here, we use the mouse ear pinna lymphatic vessel network as a model system and combine lineage-tracing, genetic perturbations, whole-organ reconstructions and theoretical modeling to show that the dermal lymphatic capillaries tile space in an optimal, space-filling manner. This coverage is achieved by two complementary mechanisms: initial tissue invasion provides a non-optimal global scaffold via self-organized branching morphogenesis, while VEGF-C dependent side-branching from existing capillaries rapidly optimizes local coverage by directionally targeting low-density regions. With these two ingredients, we show that a minimal biophysical model can reproduce quantitatively whole-network reconstructions, across development and perturbations. Our results show that lymphatic capillary networks can exploit local self-organizing mechanisms to achieve tissue-scale optimization., The lymphatic system is a transport network that controls immune response and tissue fluid circulation in the body. Here the authors combine experiment and theory to reveal that developing lymphatic capillary networks exploit complementary branching strategies to optimize tissue coverage.},

  abstract  = {Abstract: Vascular networks are dynamic structures, adapting to changing conditions by structural remodelling of vessel diameters and by growth of new vessels and regression of existing vessels. The vast number of blood vessels in the circulatory system, more than 109, implies that vessels’ arrangement and structure are not under individual genetic control but emerge as a result of generic responses of each segment to the various stimuli that it experiences. To obtain insight into the types of response that are needed, a network-oriented approach has been used, in which theoretical models are used to simulate structural adaptation in vascular networks, and the results are compared with experimental observations. With regard to the structural control of vessel diameters, this approach shows that responses to both haemodynamic and metabolic stimuli are needed for the formation of functionally adequate and efficient network structures. Furthermore, information transfer in both upstream and downstream directions is essential for balancing flows between long and short flow pathways. Otherwise, functional shunting occurs, that is, short pathways become enlarged and flow bypasses longer pathways. Information transfer in the upstream direction is achieved by conducted responses communicated along vessel walls. Simulations of structural adaptation in tumour microvascular networks indicate that impaired vascular communication, resulting in functional shunting, may be an important factor causing the dysfunctional microcirculation and local hypoxia typically observed in tumours. Anti-angiogenic treatment of tumours may restore vascular communication and thereby improve or normalize flow distribution in tumour vasculature.},

Whilst the major mechanisms contributing to the formation of new blood vessels have been well explored in recent years, vascular remodeling and quiescence remain poorly understood. In this review, we highlight the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for vessel remodeling and quiescence during angiogenesis. We further underline how impaired remodeling and/or destabilization of vessel networks can contribute to vascular pathologies.

  abstract  = {Understanding vascular development in vertebrates is an important scientific endeavor. Normal vasculatures generally start off as a disorganized capillary lattice which progressively matures into a well-organized vascular loop comprising a hierarchy of arteries and veins. One striking feature of vascular development is the interlacing of arteries and veins. How arteries and veins manage to avoid themselves and interlace with such a perfect architecture is not understood. Here we present a detailed view of the development of the vasculature in the chorioallantoic membrane of the chicken embryo. We find that the origin of arteriovenous interlacing lies in the presence of an increased hemodynamic resistance at the distal part of the arteries due to vascular flattening onto the ectodermal surface. This reduces the vascular conductance distally, thus repelling veins away. In more proximal parts, vessels round off into cylinders and the increased flow attracts veins.},

Often, the relevant optimization functional is nonconvex and characterized by many local extrema. In general, finding the global, or nearly global optimum is difficult. In biological systems, it is believed that such an optimal state is slowly achieved through natural selection. However, general coarse grained models for flow networks with local positive feedback rules for the vessel conductivity typically get trapped in low efficiency, local minima. In this work we show how the growth of the underlying tissue, coupled to the dynamical equations for network development, can drive the system to a dramatically improved optimal state. This general model provides a surprisingly simple explanation for the appearance of highly optimized transport networks in biology such as leaf and animal vasculature.},
