\section{Solved Problems}
\begin{problem}
	Smith enters a bank with two tellers who just started processing Allen and Yang. Assume that the processing time depends on the special kind of online authentication whose waiting time is a random variable that has a exponential distribution with some constant $ \lambda $ that is constant for all costumers. What is the probability that Smith will leave the bank the last?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	Smith should wait until either Allen or Yang is finished. After either is processed (without loss of generality, assume Allen got served and Yang is still waiting), then one of the tellers will give start serving Smith. Let $ T $ be a random variable showing the waiting time of Smith and $ S $ be a random variable representing the waiting time of Yang, both of which are i.i.d. random variables with exponential distribution. First note that since exponential random variables are memory less, then we have
	\[ \prob(S>s+t|S>s) = \prob(S>t). \]
	We can formulate the Smith leaving the first as 
	\[ \prob(T<S). \]
	By the law of total probabilities we have
	\[ \prob(T<S) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\prob(T<s)f(s)\ ds = \int_{0}^{\infty}(1-e^{\lambda s}) \lambda e^{-\lambda s}\ ds = 1 - \frac12 = \frac12. \]
