\chapter{Finite Element Methods}

In this chapter, we will cover the basics of the theory of finite element methods. 

\section{Basics and Notations}
For convenience in notation for partial derivatives, we introduce the following notation using the multi-index.

\begin{definition}[Definition of multi-index]
	Let $ n \in \N $. Then the following $m$-tuple
	\[ \alpha = (\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_n) \in \R^n \]
	is called a multi-index, with its length defined as
	\[ \abs{\alpha} = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \cdots + \alpha_n \]
\end{definition}

Now we can have a very compact notation for the partial derivatives of a function using the notion of multi-index.

\begin{definition}[Partial derivatives with multi-index]
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $, and $ f:\Omega \to \R $ be $ m $-times continuously differentiable. Then we have
	\[ D^\alpha f = \big( \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1} \big)^{\alpha_1} \big( \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2} \big)^{\alpha_2}  \cdots \big( \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n} \big)^{\alpha_n}f = \frac{\partial^{\abs{\alpha}}}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1}\ \partial x_2^{\alpha_2}\ \cdots \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} f. \]
	Note that since the function is $ m $-times differentiable, then the above definition is defined for $ \abs{\alpha} < m $.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Suppose that $ n=3 $, and $ \Omega \subset \R^3 $. Define $ f: \Omega \to \R $. Then we have
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{\abs{\alpha}=3} D^{\alpha} f &=  (\frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_1^{3}} + \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_2^{3}} + \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_3^{3}} + \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_1^{2}\partial x_2^{1}} + \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_1^{1}\partial x_2^{2}} + \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_2^{1}\partial x_3^{2}} + \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_2^{2}\partial x_3^{1}} \\
		&+ \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_1^{1}\partial x_3^{2}} + \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_1^{2}\partial x_3^{1}} + \frac{\partial^3}{\partial x_1^{1}\partial x_2^{1}\partial x_3^{1}})f.
	\end{align*}
	This example shows how we can simply avoid writing 10 terms using a appropriately designed notation.
\end{example}

\subsection{Space of Continuously Differentiable Functions}

Now we review some basic definitions about the function spaces.
\begin{definition}[Space of continuous functions]
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $, an open region. The space of all continuous functions defined on this region is denoted by $ \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega) $ and defined as follows
	\[ \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega) = \Set{f:\Omega\to \R \ :\ f \text{ is continuous}}. \]
	Also, let $ \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega})$ denote the set of all functions $ f\in \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}) $ that can be extended from $ \Omega $ to a continuous function defined on $ \closure{\Omega} $.\\
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	Note that since $ \closure{\Omega} $ compact, then all of the functions in $ \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}) $ are bounded. That is true because all the continuous functions defined on a compact set are uniformally continuous, thus bounded.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
	Let $ \Omega = (0,1) $. Then $ f: \Omega \to \R $, where $ f(x) = 1/x $ is in $ \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega) $ but not in $ \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}) $. I.e.
	\[ f \in \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega), \qquad f\notin \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}). \]
\end{example}


\begin{proposition}[Vector space structure of the space of continuous functions]
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $. The space $ \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega) $ is a vector space. A suitable norm for this space is defined as follows
	\[ \norm{f} = \norm{f}_\infty = \sup_{x\in \Omega}\abs{f(X)},\]
	where $ f \in \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega) $.
\end{proposition}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $ f \in \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}) $. Then
	\[ \norm{f}_\infty = \sup_{x\in \Omega}\abs{f(x)} = \max_{x\in \Omega}\abs{f(x)}. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	A continuous function defined on a compact set attains its maximum and minimum in the set. 
\end{proof}
Now we can define the space of $ k $-times continuously differentiable functions. 

\begin{definition}[The space of k-times continuously differentiable functions]
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $. Then we define the space of $ k $-times continuously differentiable functions defined on $ \Omega $ as 
	\[ \mathscr{C}^k(\Omega) = \Set{f \in \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega)\ :\ D^\alpha f \in \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega) \quad \text{for}\ \abs{\alpha} \leq k   }. \]
\end{definition}

Similar to the space of all continuous functions, the space of all $ k $-times continuously differentiable functions also has a vector space structure as reflected by the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $. Then $ \mathscr{C}^k(\Omega) $ is a vector space. The following norm is a useful norm for this space. 
	\[  \norm{f}_{\mathscr{C}^k} = \sum_{\abs{\alpha} \leq k} \norm{D^\alpha f}_\infty. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{remark}
	We can of course come up with many other norms, some of them as good as the norm defined above. 
	\[ \norm{f}_{\mathscr{C}^k} = \big(\sum_{\abs{\alpha} \leq k} \norm{D^\alpha f}^p_\infty \big)^{1/p}. \]
	And if we let $ p \to \infty $ then 
	\[ \norm{f}_{\mathscr{C}^k} = \sup_{\abs{\alpha}\leq k} \norm{D^\alpha f}_\infty = \max_{\abs{\alpha}\leq k} \norm{D^\alpha f}_\infty. \]
	Note that we say these norms are good in a sense that it makes the space of interest a complete normed vector space, i.e. a Banach space. 
\end{remark}

\begin{observation}
	Considering the remark above, $ \mathscr{C}^k(\Omega) $ kind of resembles the Euclidean space $ \R^n $ in the sense of extending a norm from $ \R $ to $ \R^k $.
\end{observation}

The following example demonstrates all of these definitions in a more concrete example.

\begin{example}
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^2 $, open and bounded. The the space of all one time continuously differentiable functions is
	\[ \mathscr{C}^1(\Omega) = \Set{f\in \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega)\ :\ \partial_{x}f \in \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega)\ \text{and}\ \partial_y f \in \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega)}. \]
	And the corresponding suitable norm for this space is
	\[ \norm{f}_{\mathscr{C}^k} = \norm{f}_\infty  + \norm{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}}_\infty + \norm{\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}}_\infty. \]
\end{example}

\subsection{Space of Lebesgue Integrable Functions}
Here, we define some spaces of functions that are basically characterizing the growth and decay rate of functions. The following definition makes this more clear. 
\begin{definition}
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $, and let $ p\geq 1 $ be a real number. Then we define
	\[ \tilde{L}_p(\Omega) = \Set{f:\Omega\to\R\ :\ \big(\int_\Omega \abs{f(x)}^p dx \big)^{1/p} < \infty} \]
\end{definition}

The following proposition is very crucial for our up coming discussions.
\begin{proposition}
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $, and $ p\geq 1 $. Then $ (\tilde{L}_p(\Omega)/\!\!\sim, \norm{\cdot}_{L_p}) $ is a normed vector space, where $ \sim $ is a equivalence relation defined on the set $ L_p(\Omega) $ identifying the functions that are equal almost everywhere. Further more the norm is defined as
	\[ \norm{f}_{L_p} = \big(\int_\Omega \abs{f(x)}^p dx\big)^{1/p}.\]
	We denote 
	\[  L_p(\Omega) :=  \tilde{L}_p(\Omega)/\!\!\sim \]
\end{proposition}
\begin{remark}
	There are some notes to emphasis here. \\
	1. We defined the $ L_p(\Omega) $ to be the quotient set $ \tilde{L}_p(\Omega)/\!\!\sim  $. The reason for that is because the $ \norm{\cdot}_{L^p} $, when defined on $\tilde{L}_p$ is no longer a norm, as it is not positive definite. I.e., the norm of a function in $ \tilde{L_p} $ can be zero, while the function is not identically zero, but is zero almost everywhere, i.e. on a set of measure zero. That is why we need to identify the functions that are equal almost everywhere. \\
	2. To check to see see if the norm defined as above satisfies the properties of norm, we can use the Minkowski inequality to show that it satisfies the triangle inequality. However, for the spacial case $ p=2 $ we can show this by using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Yes! we can define inner product when $ p=2 $ and utilize the properties of Cauchy Schwartz inequality.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}[H\"{o}lder's inequality]
	Let $ u\in L_p(\Omega) $ and $ v \in L_q(\Omega) $ where $ 1/p + 1/q = 1. $
	Then we have
	\[ \norm{uv}_{L^1} = \norm{u}_{L^p} \norm{v}_{L^q} \]
\end{proposition}

The following theorem is among the central theorems for this chapter. 

\begin{theorem}[$ L_p $ space is a Banach space]
	Let $ \Omega\subset \R$. Then the space $ L_p(\Omega) $ (where $ p \geq 1 $) is a complete normed vector space, i.e. Banach space. 
\end{theorem}

When we let $ p\to \infty $, we will get the space $ L_\infty(\Omega) $, another interesting $ L_p  $ space that has characterizations quite similar to $ \mathscr{C}^0 $. 

\begin{proposition}[$ L_\infty $ space.]
	Consider the space $ L_p(\Omega) $. If we let $ p\to \infty $, we will get the space $ L_\infty(\Omega) $ that is defined as
	\[ L_\infty(p) = \Set{f: \Omega\to \R\ :\ \text{$ f $ is finite bounded almost everywhere}}, \]
	and the corresponding norm for this space is
	\[ \norm{f}_{L_\infty} = \operatorname{ess.sup}_{x\in \Omega} \abs{f(x)}. \]
	This space is also a Banach space. 
\end{proposition}


For $ L_p(\Omega) $ when $ p=2 $ then something interesting happens, and the space $ L_2(\Omega) $ has so many useful features that is the horse power of the modern PDE analysis, among many other applications. 

\begin{proposition}[$ L^2 $ is a Hilbert space]
	$ L_2(\Omega) $ is a Hilbert space (a Banach space equipped with an inner product) with the following inner product
	\[ (u,v) = \int_\Omega {u(x)v(x)} dx. \]
	Clearly
	\[ \norm{u}_{L_2} = \sqrt{(u,u)}. \]
\end{proposition}
Since the inner product defined on $ L_2(\Omega) $ an actual inner product (look at this tautology!), then it satisfies the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.

\begin{proposition}
	Consider the Hilbert space $ L_2(\Omega) $. Then for all $ u,v \in L_2(\Omega) $ we have
	\[ \abs{(u,v)} \leq \norm{u}_{L^2} \norm{v}_{L^2} \]
\end{proposition} 

\begin{remark}
	Among many other applications, we can use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to show that the $ L_2 $ norm satisfies the triangle inequality. To show this, we begin with
	\[  \norm{u+v}_{L_2}^2 = (u+v,u+v) = \norm{u}^2_{L_2} + \norm{v}^2_{L_2} + 2(u,v) \leq (\norm{u}^2_{L_2} + \norm{v}^2_{L_2})^2 . \]
	Then this implies
	\[ \norm{u+v}_{L_2} \leq \norm{u}_{L_2} + \norm{v}_{L_2}. \]
\end{remark}

\subsection{Sobolev Spaces}
So far, given a domain $ \Omega \subset \R^n $, we have introduced the notion of the space of functions defined on the domain to group them in different categories based on the similar properties that they posses. For instance, we group all the functions (defined on $ \Omega $) that are continuous into the set $ \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega) $ and grouped all the functions that are square integrable into $ L_2(\Omega) $ and etc. If I want to visualize these space and highlight the relation between them, I would suggest the following diagram (assume $ \Omega $ is bounded).
\input{Images/WorldOfFunctions1.tex}
\FloatBarrier
\noindent Then the notion of the weak derivatives, and the Sobolev spaces come into play. We can define the notion of weak derivative for the functions that do not posses derivative in the classical sense, like the the function corresponding to the mapping $ x\mapsto \abs{x} $. 

For simplicity, we focus on the first derivative and try to generalize that notion. To do this, we need to focus on the set of functions that are continuously differentiable, i.e. $ \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega) $. Let $ f\in \mathscr{C}^0(\Omega) $. Then this function satisfies the following integration by parts identity
\[  \boxed{\int_\Omega f\ u'\ dx =  -\int_\Omega f'\ u\ dx, \qquad \forall u \in \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega).} \]
Where $ \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega) $ is the set of all smooth functions with compact support. The identity above holds because
\[  \int_\Omega f\ u'\ dx  = \underbrace{\big[f\ u\big]_{\partial \Omega}}_{0}-\int_\Omega f'\ u\ dx . \]
Note that the boundary above is zero since the function $ u $ has compact support, thus it is zero at the boundary. Now using this identity, we can extend the notion of derivatives to the functions that do not posses derivatives in the classic sense. This is the intuitive idea behind the notion of Sobolev spaces. 

\begin{definition}[Sobolev Spaces]
	Let $ \Omega\subset \R^n $. Then we define $ W^{k,p} $ to be the space of functions in $ L_p(\Omega) $ that posses $ k $ weak derivatives that belong to $ L_p(\Omega) $. In other words, for $ k $ a non-negative integer, we have
	\[ W^{k,p} = \Set{u\in L_p(\Omega)\ :\  u_\alpha \in L_p(\Omega),\ \abs{\alpha} \leq k }, \]
	Where $ u_\alpha $ defined to be
	\[  u_\alpha = v \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \int_\Omega u\ D^\alpha f\ dx = (-1)^{\abs{\alpha}} \int_\Omega v f \ dx, \quad \forall f \in \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega). \]
	Or in a more compact notation we can write
	\[ u_\alpha = v \quad  \Longleftrightarrow \quad (u,D^\alpha f) = (v,f). \]
	So we can use the following equivalent definition for the Sobolev spaces.
	\[ W^{k,p} = \Set{u \in L_p(\Omega)\ :\ \exists v \in L_p(\Omega) \st (u,D^\alpha f) = (v,f) \quad \forall f \in \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega)}. \]
	Note that we sometimes, when there is not ambiguity, we denote the weak derivative of $ u $ with $ u_\alpha $ and $ D^\alpha u $ interchangeably.
\end{definition}

\begin{beCareful}
	Consider the following definition of $ W^{k,p} $
	\[ W^{k,p} = \Set{u \in L_p(\Omega)\ :\ \exists v \in L_p(\Omega) \st (u,D^\alpha f) = (v,f) \quad \forall f \in \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega)}. \]
	A careful reader might raise the question that how does one know that the integral $ (u, D^\alpha f) $ exists given $ u \in L_p(\Omega) $ and $ D^\alpha f \in \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega) $? To show this we utilize the H\"{o}lder's inequality. First, observe that $ \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega) \subset L_p(\Omega)$ for all $ p\geq 1 $, and in particular $ \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega) \subset L_q(\Omega) $ where $ 1/q = 1-1/p $. Thus using the H\"{o}lder's inequality we can write
	\[ (u, D^\alpha f) = \int_\Omega \abs{u\ D^\alpha f}\ dx \leq \norm{u}_{L_p} \norm{D^\alpha f}_{L_q} < \infty. \]
\end{beCareful}


The following proposition shows that the Sobolev spaces are actually normed vector spaces.

\begin{theorem}[Sobolev spaces are normed vector spaces]
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $. Then $ (W^{k,p}(\Omega), \norm{\cdot}_{W^{k,p}(\Omega)}) $ is a normed vector space. For $ u \in W^{k,p}(\Omega) $ we have
	\[  \norm{u}_{W^{k,p}(\Omega)} = \big(\sum_{\abs{\alpha}\leq k}\norm{D^\alpha u}^p_{L_p(\Omega)}\big)^{1/p}.  \]
	Also we define the semi-norm (this is semi-norm since it is not positive definite) as
	\[ \abs{u}_{W^{k,p}(\Omega)} = \big(\sum_{\abs{\alpha} =  k}\norm{D^\alpha u}^p_{L_p(\Omega)}\big)^{1/p}.\]
	Thus the norm can be written as 
	\[ \norm{u}_{W^{k,p}(\Omega)} = \big( \sum_{i=1}^{k}\abs{u}^p_{W^{i,p}(\Omega)} \big)^{1/p}. \]
\end{theorem}
For the special case where $ p=2 $, the Sobolev space $ W^{k,2}(\Omega) $ will have more interesting features as summarized bellow.

\begin{proposition}[$ W^{k,2}(\Omega) $ is a Hilbert space]
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $. Then $ W^{k,2}(\Omega) $ is a Hilbert space with the following inner product
	\[ (u,v)_{W^{k,2}(\Omega)} = \sum_{\abs{\alpha}\leq k}(D^\alpha u, D^\alpha v). \]
	We usually denote this space as
	\[  H^k := W^{k,2}(\Omega). \]
\end{proposition}

The definitions and notations above are for the general setting. However, throughout this notes we will mostly be working with $ H_1(\Omega) $ and $ H^2(\Omega) $. So in the following example we will go through the definitions for these special cases to train our eye for those notations.

\begin{example}[Special cases of Sobolev spaces]
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $. Then $ H^1(\Omega) $ and $ H^2(\Omega) $ are the set of all square integrable functions that posses first and second weak derivatives respectively.\\
	We start with $ H^1(\Omega) $ which is defined to be
	\[ H^1(\Omega) = \Set{f\in L_2(\Omega)\ :\ \big(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\big) \in L_2(\Omega),\ i=1,2,\cdots,n },\]
	\[ \norm{u}_{H^1(\Omega)} = \big(\norm{f}^2_{L_2(\Omega)} + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\norm{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}}_{L_2(\Omega)}^2\big)^{1/2}, \] 
	\[ \abs{u}_{H^1(\Omega)} = \big(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\norm{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}}_{L_2(\Omega)}^2\big)^{1/2} \]
	
	Similarly, for $ H^2(\Omega) $ we can write
	\begin{align*}
		H^2(\Omega) = &\{ f:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}\ : (\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}) \in L_2(\Omega),\ i=1,2,\ldots,n, \nonumber \\
		&\phantom{{}= \{ f:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}\ :} (\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}) \in L_2(\Omega),\ i,j=1,2,\ldots,n \}.
	\end{align*}
	\[ \norm{u}_{H^2(\Omega)} = \big( \norm{u}^2_{L_2(\Omega)} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \norm{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}}^2_{L_2(\Omega)}  + \sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \norm{\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}}_{L_2(\Omega)}\big)^{1/2}, \]
	and for the semi-norm we have
	\[ \abs{u}_{H^2(\Omega)} = \big(\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \norm{\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}}_{L_2(\Omega)}\big)^{1/2}. \]
\end{example}

The following definition introduces an important special Sobolev space.

\begin{definition}[Definition of $ H_0^1(\Omega) $]
	The Sobolev space $ H_0^1(\Omega) $ is defined to be the closure of $ \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega) $ under $ \norm{\cdot}_{H^1(\Omega)} $ norm. I.e. for any sequence $ \set{u_n} $ in $ \mathscr{C}^\infty_c(\Omega) $ that converges to $ u^* $ under $ \norm{\cdot}_{H^1(\Omega)} $, then $ u^* \in H_0^1 $.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	For instance, Let $ \Omega = [-1,1] $. Then the following function is in $ H^1_0(\Omega) $.
	\[ 
	f(x) = \begin{cases}
		1-\abs{x} \qquad &x\in[-1/2,1/2],\\
		0 \qquad &\text{else}.
	\end{cases}
	 \]
\end{remark}

The following proposition gives us some intuitive characterization of $ H^1_0(\Omega) $.

\begin{proposition}
	Let $ \Omega \subset\R^n $ an open set with a sufficiently smooth boundary. Then 
	\[ H_0^1(\Omega) = \Set{f \in H^1(\Omega)\ :\ f(\partial \Omega) = 0}.   \]
\end{proposition}

We conclude this section with the important inequality of Poincar\'{e}-Friedrichs inequality.

\begin{theorem}[Poincar\'{e}-Friedrichs inequality]
	\label{thm:PoincareInequality}
	Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $. Then $ \exists C_{\star} \in \R $ that depends on the geometry of the domain $ \Omega $ and for all $ u \in H_0^1(\Omega) $ we have
	\[ \int_\Omega \abs{u(x)}^2\ dx \leq  C_{\star} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_\Omega \Abs{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}}^2\ dx, \qquad \forall u \in H_0^1. \]
	Or equivalently we can write this in a more compact notation as follows
	\[ \norm{u}_{L_2(\Omega)} \leq \tilde{C_{\star}} \abs{u}_{H^1}. \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	To demonstrate the simplicity of the proof for such an un-intuitive result, we start with assuming $ \Omega = [a,b] \subset \R $. Let $ u \in H^1_0(\Omega) $. Then we can write
	\[ u(x) = u(a) + \int_{a}^{x}u'(\xi)\ d\xi = \int_{a}^{x}u'(\xi)\ d\xi, \qquad a\leq x\leq b \]
	Note that since $ u \in H_0^1(\Omega) $, then $ u $ is zero at the boundary. Now we can write
	\[ \int_{a}^{b} \abs{u(x)}^2 dx = \int_{a}^{b}\abs{\int_{a}^{x}u'(\xi)\ d\xi}^2 d\xi. \]
	We can simplify the inner integral using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality
	\[ \int_{a}^{x} u'(\xi)\ d\xi \leq (x-a)^{1/2}(\int_{a}^{x}\abs{u'(\xi)}^2\ d\xi)^{1/2} \]
	Also, note that we can write
	\[ \int_{a}^{x} \abs{u'(\xi)}^2\ d\xi \leq \int_{a}^{b}\abs{u'(\xi)}^2\ d\xi.  \]
	This is true since the integrand is always positive. Putting the pieces together we can not write
	\[ \int_{a}^{b} \abs{u(x)}^2 dx = \int_{a}^{b}\abs{\int_{a}^{x}u'(\xi)\ d\xi}^2 d\xi \leq \frac{(b-a)^2}{2} \int_{a}^{b}\abs{u'(\xi)}^2\ d\xi. \]
	
	For another simple case $ \Omega = [a,b]\times [c,d] \subset \R^2 $, the proof will be pretty much analogous to the proof above, with a difference that we will need to find an upper bound for $\int_{a}^{b}\int_{c}^{d}\abs{u(x,y)}^2dydx$ twice (one with respect to the $ u_x $ and the other one with respect to $ u_y $). Also, note that we will need to use the identity that for every $ a,b >0 $, $ ab/(a+b) $ is an upper bound for both $ a $ and $ b $. Eventually we can show that 
	\[ \int_{\Omega} \abs{u(x,y)}^2\ dxdy \leq \underbrace{(\frac{2}{(d-c)^2} + \frac{2}{(b-a)^2})^{-1}}_{C_\star}\int_\Omega (\abs{u_x}^2 + \abs{u_y}^2) dxdy \]
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
	Let $ \Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1] \subset \R^2$. Then we have
	\[ \int_\Omega\abs{u(x,y)}^2 dxdy \leq \frac{1}{4} \int_\Omega (\abs{u_x(x,y)}^2 + \abs{u_y(x,y)}^2)\ dxdy \qquad \forall u \in H_0^1(\Omega) \]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Let $ \Omega = [0,1] \subset \R $. Then we have
	\[ \int_\Omega\abs{u(x,y)}^2 dx \leq \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \abs{u_x(x,y)}^2 \ dx \qquad \forall u \in H_0^1(\Omega) \]
\end{example}





\section{PDEs and the Weak Solutions}

\subsection{Introduction and Motivation}
Let $ \Omega \subset \R^2 $ and consider a boundary value problem where we want to find $ u: \Omega \to \R $ that satisfies
\[ -\Delta u = f, \qquad u = 0 \quad \text{on $ \partial \Omega $}. \]
Given $ f \in \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega})$ is continuous, then the classical theory of PDEs guarantees that there exists $ u \in \mathscr{C}^2(\Omega) \cap \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}) $ that satisfies the PDF above, as well as the boundary condition (this solution is called a \textbf{classical solution}). For instance, the solution for $ f=1 $ is shown as below.


\begin{figure}[h!]

	\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/PoissonEquationWithContours.png}

	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
But what if the function $ f $ is not continuous? Does that imply that a solution does not exists? However, we can observe solutions for such problems in experimental setting. Thus we need to weaken the requirements in order to study this problem in a more general setting. For instance, if the function $ f $ is given as

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{Images/discontFunction}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

where 
\[ f(x,y) = \operatorname{sign}(\frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}). \]
By numerical solution, we find that the solution $ u $ is as demonstrated in the following figure.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/weakSolutionPoissonEquation.png}

	\begin{minipage}{0.45\linewidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/weakSolutionPoissonEquationContour.png}
		
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
In this section of the notes, we will develop a theory to study such ``weak'' solutions.


\subsection{Weak Solutions to Elliptic Problems}

\subsubsection*{General formulation of elliptic problem}
Here, we consider the following general case of the elliptic problems. Let $ \Omega \subset \R^n $ with sufficiently smooth boundary. Then an elliptic problem is a partial differential equation, and a boundary condition, where the differential equation is
\begin{align*}
	 -\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(a_{ij}(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} + c(x) u = f, \qquad x \in \Omega \tag{5.2.1}
\end{align*}
or in a much more compact vector notation, we can write
\[  -\div{(A^T \grad{u})} + B \cdot \grad{u} + c u = f,  \]
where
\begin{align*}
	b_i \in \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}), \qquad c \in \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}),\\
	f \in \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}), \qquad a_{ij} \in \mathscr{C}^1(\closure{\Omega}) \tag{5.2.1.C}
\end{align*}
Also, we require that there must exist a positive constant $ c \in \R $ such that
 \begin{equation}
	\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} a_{ij}(x) \xi_i \xi_j \geq \tilde{c} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\xi_i^2 \quad \forall \xi \in \R^n,\ x \in \Omega. 
\label{equ:ellipticityCondition}
\end{equation}

The condition above is called the uniform ellipticity condition and the equation $ (5.2.1) $ is called an elliptic PDE. Now we can impose different boundary conditions on the PDE to formulate our boundary value problem. The choices are
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]	
	\item $ u = g $ on $ \partial \Omega $. This is known as a Dirichlet boundary condition.
	\item $ D_v u = \grad{u}\cdot v = g $ on $ \partial \Omega $, where $ D_v $ is the directional derivative of $ u $ in the direction $ v $ which is the unit outward normal vector to $ \partial \Omega $. This is known as a Neumann boundary condition. 
	\item $ D_v u + u = g $. This is called a Robin boundary condition.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Formulating the Weak Form For Homogeneous Dirichlet Boundary Value Problem }
Here, we focus on solving the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary value problem which is
\begin{align*}
	-\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(a_{ij}(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} + c(x) u &= f, \qquad x \in \Omega \\
	u &= 0 \qquad \text{on}\ \partial \Omega \tag{5.2.$\clubsuit$}
\end{align*}
where $ a_{ij}, b_i, c, f $ are as in (5.2.1.C). A function $ u \in \mathscr{C}^2(\Omega) \cap \mathscr{C}^0(\closure{\Omega}) $ is called a \textbf{classic solution} to the Dirichlet boundary value problem ($ u \in \mathscr{C}^2(\Omega)\cap \mathscr{C}^1(\closure{\Omega}) $ in the case of Neumann problem which will be discussed later). Note that the boundary of the domain $ \Omega $ should be smooth enough in order for the classical solution to exist. However, we want to weaken this requirement and find a more general class of solutions. To do this, we first need to find some property, or some identity that holds for the classic solution and extend that for more general solutions (similar to what we did for extending the notion of derivatives and making the notion of weak derivative). 

Let $ v \in \mathscr{C}^1_c(\Omega) $ (the set of continuously differentiable functions defined on $ \Omega $ that has compact support). Multiplying both sides of the PDE by $ v $  and then using integration by parts for the first term, and also observing that $ v $ is zero in the boundary (since it has a compact support) then we can write
\[ \sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\int_\Omega a_{ij}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_j}\dx +\sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_\Omega b_i(x)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} v\dx + \int_\Omega c(x) u v\dx = \int_\Omega fv\dx \qquad \forall v \in \mathscr{C}^1_c(\Omega) \]
The equation above is the satisfied by a classical solution, and we have only the first derivative of the solution in the identity above. Thus this is a good place to extend the notion of the solution. In order for the identity above to make sense, we need to make sure the integrals exists, which is true when considering the classic solution. That is because all of the integrands are continuous functions, thus they exists. However, we can use Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to obtain
\[\Abs{ \int_\Omega a_{ij}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_j}\dx }^2 \leq \Par{\int_\Omega \abs{a_{ij}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}}^2\dx}\Par{\int_\Omega \abs{\frac{\partial v}{\partial x_j}}^2\dx}\]
\[ \Abs{\int_\Omega b_i(x)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} v \dx}^2 \leq \Par{\int_\Omega \abs{v}^2\dx}\Par{\int_\Omega \abs{b_i(x)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}}^2 \dx} \]
Thus the identity satisfied by the classic solution also makes sense if we have much more relaxed requirement on $ u $ and $ v $, namely just requiring
\[ u \in H^1_0 (\Omega), \qquad v \in H^1_0, \qquad f \in L_2(\Omega) \]
Also, since that since no derivative is performed on $ a_{ij} $, then we can relax the condition on $ a_{ij} $ to be $ a_{ij} \in L_2(\Omega) $, as well as the smoothness conditions on $ b_i $ and $ c $ that can be relaxed to $ b_i, c \in L_\infty(\Omega) $. Note that $ a_{ij},b_i,c $ should still be essentially bounded in order for $ b_i \partial u/\partial x_i $, $ a_{ij}\partial u/\partial x_i $, and $ c u $ be square integrable.

\noindent Now we can formulate the weak problem as follows.
\begin{quote}
	Find $ u \in H_0^1 $ such that $ \forall v \in H_0^1 $ it satisfies
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\int_\Omega a_{ij}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_j}\dx +\sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_\Omega b_i(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} v\dx + \int_\Omega c(x) u v\dx = \int_\Omega fv\dx \quad x\in \Omega,\ \forall v \in H_0^1(\Omega) 
	\end{align*}
	where $ a_{ij}, b_i, c \in L_\infty(\Omega) $, and $ f \in L_2(\Omega) $.
\end{quote}

This motivates the following definition.

\begin{definition}[Weak Solution of Elliptic Dirichlet Homogeneous Boundary Value Problem]
	\label{def:ellipticDirichletBVPWeak}
	Let $ a_{ij}, b_i, c_i \in L_\infty(\Omega) $, and $ f \in L_2(\Omega) $. Then a function $ u \in H_0^1(\Omega) $ that $ \forall v \in H_0^1(\Omega) $ satisfies
	\[ \sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\int_\Omega a_{ij}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_j}\dx +\sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_\Omega b_i(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} v\dx + \int_\Omega c(x) u v\dx = \int_\Omega fv\dx \quad x\in \Omega  \]
	is called a weak solution to $ (5.2.2.\clubsuit) $. Note that all of the derivatives should be considered in the weak sense. 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	Clearly, if $ u $ is a classic solution, then it is also a weak solution, but because of the relaxed conditions on the weak formulation, a weak solution is not necessarily a classic solution.
\end{remark}
Now it remains to show the existence uniqueness of the solution to the weak formulation and the corresponding requirements. 

\subsubsection{Existence and Uniqueness of The Weak Solutions}
In order to use the theoretical machinery of functional analysis, first we need to express our problem in a more useful way. Let $ a: H_0^1 \times H_0^1 \to \R$ be a bi-linear form define as
\[ a(u,v) =  \sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\int_\Omega a_{ij}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_j}\dx +\sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_\Omega b_i(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} v\dx + \int_\Omega c(x) u v\dx, \]
and $ l: H_0^1 \to \R $ a linear functional given as
\[ l(v) = \int_\Omega fv\dx. \]
Then we can re-write our Dirichlet boundary condition as the following alternative notation.
\begin{definition}[Alternative Notation For The Weak Solution of Elliptic Dirichlet Boundary Value Problem]
	An alternative notation for \autoref{def:ellipticDirichletBVPWeak} is given as: Find $ u \in H_0^1(\Omega) $ such that 
	\[ a(u,v) = l(v) \qquad \forall v \in H_0^1(\Omega) \]
\end{definition}

The notation above is very useful, as we can now use Lax-Milgram theorem to discuss the existence and uniqueness of the boundary value problem under study. First, we need to state the Lax-Milgram theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Lax-Milgram Theorem]
	Let $ V $ be a Hilbert space, $ a:V\times V \to \R $ a bi-linear form, $ l: V \to \R $ a linear functional that satisfies the following properties.
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Coercivity: $ \exists c_0>0$ such that 
		\[  {a(v,v)} \geq c_0 \norm{v}_V^2 \quad \forall v \in V \]
		\item Continuity: $ \exists c_1>0 $ such that
		\[ \abs{a(w,v)} < c_1 \norm{w}_V\norm{v}_V \quad \forall w,v \in V \]
		\item $ \exists c_2 > 0 $ st.
		\[ \abs{l(v)} < c_2 \norm{v}_V \quad \forall v \in V \]
	\end{enumerate}
	Then there exists a unique $ u \in V $ that satisfies
	\[ a(u,v) = l(v) \quad \forall v \in V. \]
\end{theorem}


Very are now just one step from showing the existence and uniqueness of the solution the weak formulation derived above. We just need to show that by letting $ V = H_0^1(\Omega) $, the bi-linear form $ a $ and the functional $ l $ have the required properties by the Lax-Milgram theorem. 



\begin{theorem}
	The elliptic problem with Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary values in \autoref{def:ellipticDirichletBVPWeak} has a unique weak solution. I.e. $ \exists u \in H_0^1(\Omega)  $ such that $ \forall v \in H_0^1(\Omega) $ we have
	\[ a(u,v) = l(v). \] 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	For the proof, we will use the Lax-Milgram theorem with $ V = H_0^1 $ and $ \norm{\cdot}_V = \norm{\cdot}_{H^1} $. We need to show that the bi-linear form $ a(u,v) $ and the linear form $ l(v) $ satisfies the required properties. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item Showing that $ a $ is continuous, i.e. we need to find $ c_1 $ such that $ \abs{a(u,v) } \leq \norm{u}_{H_1} \norm{v}_{H_1}  $. To establish this, we will use the following inequalities. 
		\[ \Abs{\int_\Omega f \dx } \leq \int_\Omega \abs{f} \dx\]
		\[ \Abs{\int_\Omega f\ g\dx} \leq \max_{x\in\Omega}{\abs{f}}\Abs{\int_\Omega g\dx} \]
		\[  (f,g)_{L^2} = \Abs{\int_\Omega f\ g \dx} \leq \Par{\int_\Omega f\dx}^{1/2} \Par{\int_\Omega g\dx}^{1/2} = \norm{f}_{L^2} \norm{g}_{L^2}. \]
		The last inequality is simply the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Note that, it is always a good idea to encapsulate the details of objects in smaller notations and use higher level of abstractions to proceed! Let 
		\[ \hat{c} = \max\set{\max_{x\in \Omega}\max_{ij} a_{ij},\ \max_{x\in \Omega}\max_{i} b_i,\  \max_{x\in \Omega} c} \]
		Then we can write
		\begin{align*}
			\abs{a(u,v)} &= \Abs{\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\int_\Omega a_{ij}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_j}\dx +\sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_\Omega b_i(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} v\dx + \int_\Omega c(x) u v\dx}\\
			&\leq \hat{c} \Par{
			\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\int_\Omega \Abs{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_j}}\dx
			+ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_\Omega  \Abs{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} v}\dx 
			+ \int_\Omega  \Abs{u v}\dx
			}\\
			&\leq \hat{c}\Par{
			\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\norm{\partial_i u}_{L_2}\norm{\partial_j v}_{L_2}
			+ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \norm{\partial_i u}_{L_2} \norm{v}_{L_2}
			+ \norm{u}_{L_2}\norm{v}_{L_2}
			}\\
			&\leq \hat{c}\Par{
				\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\norm{\partial_i u}_{L_2}\norm{\partial_j v}_{L_2}
				+ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \norm{\partial_i u}_{L_2} \norm{v}_{L_2}
				+ \sum_{j=1}^{n} \norm{\partial_j v}_{L_2} \norm{u}_{L_2}
				+ \norm{u}_{L_2}\norm{v}_{L_2} 
			}\\
			&\leq \hat{c}\Par{\norm{v}_{L_2} + \sum_{j=1}^{n}\norm{\partial_j v}_{L_2}}
			\Par{\norm{u}_{L_2} + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\norm{\partial_i u}_{L_2}}\\
			&{\color{red} \boxed{\leq}}\ 2n\hat{c}\Par{\norm{v}_{L_2}^2 + \sum_{j=1}^{n}\norm{\partial_j v}_{L_2}^2}^{1/2}
			\Par{\norm{u}_{L_2}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\norm{\partial_i u}_{L_2}^2}^{1/2}\\
			&\leq c \norm{v}_{H_1} \norm{u}_{H_1}.
		\end{align*}
		Note that in the argument above, I have highlighted the last inequality as red. That is because I don't know how this step works. This proof is provided at \hyperlink{https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/suli/fem.pdf}{FEM lecture notes}, and is called a ``further majorization''.
		
		\item To show the coercivity of $ a $, we will use the weird looking ellipticity condition \autoref{equ:ellipticityCondition} to simplify the first term in $ a(u,u) $. Also we need to relax the smoothness condition on $ b_i $ for the moment as we will see in the proof. To start the proof we can write
		\begin{align*}
			a(u,u) &= \underbrace{\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\int_\Omega a_{ij}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_j}\dx}_{\geq \tilde{c}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_\Omega (\partial_i u)^2} 
			+\sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_\Omega b_i(x) \overbrace{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} u}^{1/2(\partial_i u^2)} \dx + \int_\Omega c(x) {u}^2 \dx\\
			&\geq \tilde{c}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_\Omega (\partial_i u)^2 \dx + \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\underbrace{\int_{\partial \Omega} 1/2 b_i u^2 \dx}_{0} 
				- \int_\Omega 1/2u^2(\partial_i b_i )\dx) 
			+ \int_\Omega c(x) {u}^2 \dx \\
			&= \tilde{c}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_\Omega (\partial_i u)^2 \dx 
			+ \int_\Omega u^2 (c-\sum_{i=1}^{n}\partial_i b_i/2) \dx
		\end{align*}
		Thus if we have
		\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n}\partial_i b_i/2) \geq 0, \]
		then we can establish
		\[ a(u,u) \geq \tilde{c}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\int_\Omega (\partial_i u)^2 \dx   \]
		And by applying the Poincar\'{e} inequality \autoref{thm:PoincareInequality}, we can get
		\[ a(u,u) \geq \frac{\tilde{c}}{\tilde{C_\star}} \norm{u}_{L^2}^2 = \hat{c} \norm{u}_{L^2}^2 \]
		and as we had before
		\[ a(u,u) \geq \tilde{c}\norm{\nabla u }_{L^2}^2 \]
		Thus by choosing $ c_0 = \frac{1}{\hat{c} + \tilde{c}} $ we can write 
		\[a(u,u) \geq c_0 (\norm{u}^2_{L_2} + \norm{\grad{u}}^2_{L_2}) = c_0 \norm{u}_{H_1}^2 \]
		This proves the coercivity of the bi-linear form.
		
		Now, what remains to show is the linearity and continuity of the linear form $ l(u) $. To show this we use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality as follows
		\[ \Abs{l(v)} = \Abs{\int_\Omega u v \dx} \leq \norm{u}_{L_2} \norm{v}_{L_2} \leq \norm{u}_{L_2}\norm{v}_{H_1} = c_2 \norm{v}_{H_1}. \]
		The linearity of $ l(v) $ follows immediately from the linear property of integrals. Thus by using the Lax-Milgram theorem, we can establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
