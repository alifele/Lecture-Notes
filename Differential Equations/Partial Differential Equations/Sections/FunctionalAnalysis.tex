\chapter{Functional Analysis}

Here in this chapter we will cover some of the basics of the functional analysis and its applications to PDEs. Later, we will also all of these theories developed for numerical analysis of PDEs with finite element methods.



\section{Introduction}
Differential equations are the centeral part of the applied mathematics. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) are two major types of the differential equations. The nice thing about ODEs is that they can be formulated as a finite dimensional system, and different methods and mathematical tools ce be used to analyse these systems (like the notion of flow that is discussed in the dynamical systems course, Sturm-Lioiville theorem, Green's functions, etc). However, PDEs required their own language. The state space of a PDE is a Banach space, and the PDE itself can be seen as a combination of operators between Banach spaces, and the solutions oftern arise as weak or $ \text{weak}^* $ limits in those Banach spaces.
