\chapter{Green's Function}


In my opinion, Green's function is nothing other than expressing the solution of a problem in a nice and clean way. So I would say it acts more like a level of abstraction thing that helps to express the solution of a particular problem in a special way that can be used for more higher level thinking for further development, that otherwise would be very hard. I other words, I believe Green's function is basically looking at a solution from a different perspective. I know that all of these statements are pretty wage, but you might get some kind of similar feeling after reading this chapter!


\section{Green's function in linear algebra}
Consider the following linear equation
\[ Mu = f, \]
where $M$ is a \emph{symmetric} $n\times n$ matrix with $\det(M) \neq 0$, and $u,v \in \R^n$. Our problem is to find $u$ given the known matrix $M$ and $f$. The most simple way to approach this problem is basically 
\[ u = \inv{M}f. \]
To be honest, this is not a solution at all! This expression literally stating $Mu=f$ in an equivalent way. It is basically saying the vector $u$ can be calculated by the act of the inverse mapping $\inv{M}$ on the input function $f$. Now we can seek different ways to find this inverse mapping, which we are not discussing here. 

Instead, we are going to discuss another very simple approach, that turns out the be generalization to infinite dimensional spaces as well! The strategy is basically utilizing the fact that every non-singular symmetric function defines a natural set of orthogonal basis vector (which are actually the eigenvectors of the matrix )for the space. Let 
\[ \mathbb{B} = \set{v_i}_{i=1}^{n} \]
be the set of all eigenvectors of $M$, which corresponding eigenvalues $\set{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_i}$ (note that these eigenvalues need not to be all distinct). All these things wants to say that we have a unique factorization of every vector in the space in terms of these eigenvectors. So we can write
\[ \vec{u} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{u}_i \vec{v}_i, \qquad \vec{f} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{f}_i \vec{v}_i.   \]
Now, simply by substituting the terms in $Mu = f$, and matching the terms we will get
\[  \hat{u}_i = \frac{\hat{f}_i}{\lambda_i}.  \] 
Voila! we solved the system of equations, and the solution basically is
\[ u = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\hat{f}_i}{\lambda_i} v_i. \]
At this stage, you might finish you job and head towards the home being proud of yourself in solving this problem. But, we can do just a little bit modification to the expression above and view things from a different angle, which turns out the be very useful when considering certain problems in infinite dimensions (like ODEs and PDEs).
