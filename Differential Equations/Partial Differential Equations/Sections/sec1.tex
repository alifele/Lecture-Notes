\section{Basics}
Partial differential equations relate the partial derivatives of a function to each other. For example $f$ can be a function of spacial coordinates (like $x,y,z$ in the case of Cartesian coordinates), dynamical variable (like time), or any other kind of variables (like the space of genotypes g). For example suppose that $ \Phi(x,y) $ represents the electric potential of a point charge. Such function should satisfy the Laplace equation:

\[	 \partial_{xx} \Phi + \partial_{yy} \Phi = 0	\]. 

Note that the symbols $ \partial_{xx} $ and $ \partial_{yy} $ are short symbols for $ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^2} $ and $ \frac{\partial}{\partial y^2} $ respectively.

\begin{defbox}{Order of PDE}
	The order of a PDE is the highest derivative that occurs in the equation. 
\end{defbox}

Based on the definition above, the Laplace equation is a second order partial differential equation. 

\subsection{Classification of The Second Order PDEs }

There are three categories of the second order PDEs that every other type of a second order PDE can be converted to one of these kinds. The most general type of a second order PDE can be written as:

\begin{equation}
	A \partial_{xx} u + B \partial_{xy} u + C \partial_{yy} u + D \partial_{x} u + E \partial_{y} u + F u = k
	\label{equ:GeneralSecondOrderPDE}
\end{equation}

In which the coefficients are all a function of $x,y$ (but not $ u $ in which case the PDE will be nonlinearx). Equation \ref{equ:GeneralSecondOrderPDE} can be summarized in a more compact form using the derivative operator $ \operatorname{L} $: 

\[	 \operatorname{L} u = 0	\]

in which:

\[  \operatorname{L} = A \partial_{xx} + B \partial_{xy} + C \partial_{yy} + D \partial_{x} + E \partial_{y} + F \].

The following table summarizes special categories of the lines second order PDEs that frequently occur in physical applications: \newline
